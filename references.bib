  abstract = "To determine the clinical significance of acquired alpha

              reviewed the results of assays performed on 184 patients over a
              4-year period. Thirty-two evaluable patients had alpha
              2-antiplasmin activity levels of less than 50\% of normal
              (defined as severe deficiency), and 35 patients had levels
              between 50\% and 75\% of normal (mild deficiency). Records of
              these patients and of 32 patients who had normal levels were
              reviewed. Most patients with severe alpha 2-antiplasmin
              deficiency had either liver disease or disseminated intravascular
              coagulation and/or fibrinolysis, or both. There was a high
              incidence of severe alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency among patients
              with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Five patients with pathologic
              bleeding had no identifiable coagulation abnormalities other than
              alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency. The group with severe alpha
              2-antiplasmin deficiency had a significantly higher incidence of
              life-threatening or fatal bleeding and the most striking
              laboratory evidence of hyperfibrinolysis. Using the presence of
              severe alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency as an indication for
              therapy, epsilon-aminocaproic acid treatment was associated with

  title    = "The bleeding risk and natural history of idiopathic
              thrombocytopenic purpura in patients with persistent low platelet
              counts",
  author   = "Cohen, Y C and Djulbegovic, B and Shamai-Lubovitz, O and Mozes, B",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: No firm data are available on the natural history of
              idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or on mortality rates
              or frequency of major bleeding episodes associated with this
              condition. The disease is thought to have a relatively benign
              course, despite the frequent occurrence of very low platelet
              counts. This prevailing conception often guides therapeutic
              decisions. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the bleeding risk of ITP
              involving persistent low platelet counts (<30 x 10(9)/L) and its
              impact on prognosis. DESIGN: Age-adjusted bleeding risk was
              derived from a pooled analysis of ITP clinical series based on a
              systematic literature search. The risk estimate was incorporated
              into a Markov model to determine its impact on prognosis.
              RESULTS: Seventeen case series complied with inclusion criteria,
              including 1,817 patients with ITP. There were 49 cases of fatal
              hemorrhage over an estimated 1,258 to 3,023 patient-years at
              risk. The rate of fatal hemorrhage before age adjustment was
              estimated at between 0.0162 and 0.0389 cases per patient-year.
              Age-adjusted rates were 0.004, 0.012, and 0.130 cases per
              patient-year for age groups younger than 40, 40 to 60, and older
              than 60 years, respectively. Predicted 5-year mortality rates
              ranged from 2.2\% for patients younger than 40 years to 47.8\%
              for those older than 60 years. A 30-year-old woman remaining
              thrombocytopenic due to ITP was predicted to lose 20.4 years
              (14.9 quality-adjusted life years) of her potential life
              expectancy. At age 70, predicted loss was 9.4 years (5.0
              quality-adjusted life years). CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic
              thrombocytopenic purpura with persistent low platelet counts
              carries a grave prognosis. Therefore, an active therapeutic
              approach in the clinical management of affected patients should
              be considered. In view of the significant potential implications
              of the model results, we call for initiating a well-designed
              prospective inception cohort study of patients with ITP.",

  author   = "Bryant-Smith, Alison C and Lethaby, Anne and Farquhar, Cindy and
              Hickey, Martha",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important
              physical and social problem for women. Oral treatment for HMB
              includes antifibrinolytic drugs, which are designed to reduce
              bleeding by inhibiting clot-dissolving enzymes in the
              endometrium.Historically, there has been some concern that using
              the antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid (TXA) for HMB may increase
              the risk of venous thromboembolic disease. This is an umbrella
              term for deep venous thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessels
              in the legs) and pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the blood
              vessels in the lungs). OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness
              and safety of antifibrinolytic medications as a treatment for
              heavy menstrual bleeding. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
              Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register,
              CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registers in
              November 2017, together with reference checking and contact with
              study authors and experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: We
              included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing
              antifibrinolytic agents versus placebo, no treatment or other
              medical treatment in women of reproductive age with HMB. Twelve
              studies utilised TXA and one utilised a prodrug of TXA (Kabi).
              DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological
              procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were
              menstrual blood loss (MBL), improvement in HMB, and
              thromboembolic events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs (1312
              participants analysed). The evidence was very low to moderate
              quality: the main limitations were risk of bias (associated with
              lack of blinding, and poor reporting of study methods),
              imprecision and inconsistency.Antifibrinolytics (TXA or Kabi)
              versus no treatment or placeboWhen compared with a placebo,
              antifibrinolytics were associated with reduced mean blood loss
              (MD -53.20 mL per cycle, 95\% CI -62.70 to -43.70; I² = 8\%; 4
              RCTs, participants = 565; moderate-quality evidence) and higher
              rates of improvement (RR 3.34, 95\% CI 1.84 to 6.09; 3 RCTS,
              participants = 271; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests
              that if 11\% of women improve without treatment, 43\% to 63\% of
              women taking antifibrinolytics will do so. There was no clear
              evidence of a difference between the groups in adverse events (RR
              1.05, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 RCT, participants = 297;
              low-quality evidence). Only one thromboembolic event occurred in
              the two studies that reported this outcome.TXA versus
              progestogensThere was no clear evidence of a difference between
              the groups in mean blood loss measured using the Pictorial Blood
              Assessment Chart (PBAC) (MD -12.22 points per cycle, 95\% CI
              -30.8 to 6.36; I² = 0\%; 3 RCTs, participants = 312; very low
              quality evidence), but TXA was associated with a higher
              likelihood of improvement (RR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.31 to 1.80; I² =
              32\%; 5 RCTs, participants = 422; low-quality evidence). This
              suggests that if 46\% of women improve with progestogens, 61\% to
              83\% of women will do so with TXA.Adverse events were less common
              in the TXA group (RR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.46 to 0.94; I² = 28\%; 4
              RCTs, participants = 349; low-quality evidence). No
              thromboembolic events were reported in any group.TXA versus
              non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)TXA was associated
              with reduced mean blood loss (MD -73.00 mL per cycle, 95\% CI
              -123.35 to -22.65; 1 RCT, participants = 49; low-quality
              evidence) and higher likelihood of improvement (RR 1.43, 95\% CI
              1.18 to 1.74; 12 = 0\%; 2 RCTs, participants = 161; low-quality
              evidence). This suggests that if 61\% of women improve with
              NSAIDs, 71\% to 100\% of women will do so with TXA. Adverse
              events were uncommon and no comparative data were available. No
              thromboembolic events were reported.TXA versus ethamsylateTXA was
              associated with reduced mean blood loss (MD 100 mL per cycle,
              95\% CI -141.82 to -58.18; 1 RCT, participants = 53; low-quality
              evidence), but there was insufficient evidence to determine
              whether the groups differed in rates of improvement (RR 1.56,
              95\% CI 0.95 to 2.55; 1 RCT, participants = 53; very low quality
              evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 0.78, 95\% CI
              0.19 to 3.15; 1 RCT, participants = 53; very low quality
              evidence).TXA versus herbal medicines (Safoof Habis and Punica
              granatum)TXA was associated with a reduced mean PBAC score after
              three months' treatment (MD -23.90 pts per cycle, 95\% CI -31.92
              to -15.88; I² = 0\%; 2 RCTs, participants = 121; low-quality
              evidence). No data were available for rates of improvement. TXA
              was associated with a reduced mean PBAC score three months after
              the end of the treatment phase (MD -10.40 points per cycle, 95\%
              CI -19.20 to -1.60; I² not applicable; 1 RCT, participants = 84;
              very low quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to
              determine whether the groups differed in rates of adverse events
              (RR 2.25, 95\% CI 0.74 to 6.80; 1 RCT, participants = 94; very
              low quality evidence). No thromboembolic events were reported.TXA
              versus levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LIUS)TXA was
              associated with a higher median PBAC score than TXA (median
              difference 125.5 points; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low
              quality evidence) and a lower likelihood of improvement (RR 0.43,
              95\% CI 0.24 to 0.77; 1 RCT, participants = 42; very low quality
              evidence). This suggests that if 85\% of women improve with LIUS,
              20\% to 65\% of women will do so with TXA. There was insufficient
              evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of
              adverse events (RR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.25 to 2.80; 1 RCT,
              participants = 42; very low quality evidence). No thromboembolic
              events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antifibrinolytic
              treatment (such as TXA) appears effective for treating HMB
              compared to placebo, NSAIDs, oral luteal progestogens,
              ethamsylate, or herbal remedies, but may be less effective than
              LIUS. There were too few data for most comparisons to determine
              whether antifibrinolytics were associated with increased risk of
              adverse events, and most studies did not specifically include
              thromboembolism as an outcome.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Platelet transfusions are used in modern clinical
              practice to prevent and treat bleeding in thrombocytopenic
              patients with bone marrow failure. Although considerable advances
              have been made in platelet transfusion therapy in the last 40
              years, some areas continue to provoke debate especially
              concerning the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the
              prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding. OBJECTIVES: To determine
              the most effective use of platelet transfusion for the prevention
              of bleeding in patients with haematological disorders undergoing
              chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. SEARCH METHODS: This
              is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. We
              searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane
              Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 4, 2011),
              MEDLINE (1950 to Nov 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Nov 2011) and CINAHL
              (1982 to Nov 2011), using adaptations of the Cochrane RCT search
              filter, the UKBTS/SRI Transfusion Evidence Library, and ongoing
              trial databases to 10 November 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs
              involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either
              from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given
              to prevent bleeding in patients with haematological disorders.
              Four different types of prophylactic platelet transfusion trial
              were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In the original
              review one author initially screened all electronically derived
              citations and abstracts of papers, identified by the review
              search strategy, for relevancy. Two authors performed this task
              in the updated review. Two authors independently assessed the
              full text of all potentially relevant trials for eligibility. Two
              authors completed data extraction independently. We requested
              missing data from the original investigators as appropriate. MAIN
              RESULTS: There were 18 trials that were eligible for inclusion,
              five of these were still ongoing.Thirteen completed published
              trials (2331 participants) were included for analysis in the
              review. The original review contained nine trials (718
              participants). This updated review includes six new trials (1818
              participants).Two trials (205 participants) in the original
              review are now excluded because fewer than 80\% of participants
              had a haematological disorder.The four different types of
              prophylactic platelet transfusion trial, that were the focus of
              this review, were included within these thirteen trials.Three
              trials compared prophylactic platelet transfusions versus
              therapeutic-only platelet transfusions. There was no statistical
              difference between the number of participants with clinically
              significant bleeding in the therapeutic and prophylactic arms but
              the confidence interval was wide (RR 1.66; 95\% CI 0.9 to
              3.04).The time taken for a clinically significant bleed to occur
              was longer in the prophylactic platelet transfusion arm. There
              was a clear reduction in platelet transfusion usage in the
              therapeutic arm. There was no statistical difference between the
              number of participants in the therapeutic and prophylactic arms
              with platelet refractoriness, the only adverse event
              reported.Three trials compared different platelet count
              thresholds to trigger administration of prophylactic platelet
              transfusions. No statistical difference was seen in the number of
              participants with clinically significant bleeding (RR 1.35; 95\%
              CI 0.95 to 1.9), however, this type of bleeding occurred on fewer
              days in the group of patients transfused at a higher platelet
              count threshold (RR 1.72; 95\% CI 1.33 to 2.22).The lack of a
              difference seen for the number of participants with clinically
              significant bleeding may be due to the studies, in combination,
              having insufficient power to demonstrate a difference, or due to
              masking of the effect by a higher number of protocol violations
              in the groups of patients with a lower platelet count threshold.
              Using a lower platelet count threshold led to a significant
              reduction in the number of platelet transfusions used. There were
              no statistical differences in the number of adverse events
              reported between the two groups.Six trials compared different
              doses of prophylactic platelet transfusions. There was no
              evidence to suggest that using a lower platelet transfusion dose
              increased: the number of participants with clinically significant
              (WHO grade 2 or above) (RR 1.02; 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.11), or
              life-threatening (WHO grade 4) bleeding (RR 1.87; 95\% CI 0.86 to
              4.08). A higher platelet transfusion dose led to a reduction in
              the number of platelet transfusion episodes, but an increase in
              total platelet utilisation. Only one adverse event, wheezing
              after transfusion, had a significantly higher incidence when
              standard and high dose transfusions were compared but this
              difference was not seen when low dose and high dose transfusions
              were compared. It is therefore likely to be a type I error (false
              positive).One small trial compared prophylactic platelet
              transfusions versus platelet-poor plasma. The risk of a
              significant bleed was decreased in the prophylactic platelet
              transfusion arm (RR 0.47; 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.95) and this was
              statistically significant.All studies had threats to validity;
              the majority of these were due to methodology of the studies not
              being described in adequate detail.Although it was not the main
              focus of the review, it was interesting to note that in one of
              the pre-specified sub-group analyses (treatment type) two studies
              showed that patients receiving an autologous transplant have a
              lower risk of bleeding than patients receiving intensive
              chemotherapy or an allogeneic transplant (RR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.65
              to 0.82). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: These conclusions refer to the
              four different types of platelet transfusion trial separately.
              Firstly, there is no evidence that a prophylactic platelet
              transfusion policy prevents bleeding. Two large trials comparing
              a therapeutic versus prophylactic platelet transfusion strategy,
              that have not yet been published, should provide important new
              data on this comparison. Secondly, there is no evidence, at the
              moment, to suggest a change from the current practice of using a
              platelet count of 10 x 10(9)/L. However, the evidence for a
              platelet count threshold of 10 x 10(9)/L being equivalent to 20 x
              10(9)/L is not as definitive as it would first appear and further
              research is required. Thirdly, platelet dose does not affect the
              number of patients with significant bleeding, but whether it
              affects number of days each patient bleeds for is as yet
              undetermined. There is no evidence that platelet dose affects the
              incidence of WHO grade 4 bleeding.Prophylactic platelet
              transfusions were more effective than platelet-poor plasma at
              preventing bleeding.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy
              bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in
              people with prolonged disease-related or treatment-related
              neutropenia. Transfusions of granulocytes have a long history of
              usage in clinical practice to support and treat severe infection
              in high-risk groups of patients with neutropenia or neutrophil
              dysfunction. However, there is considerable current variability
              in therapeutic granulocyte transfusion practice, and uncertainty
              about the beneficial effect of transfusions given as an adjunct
              to antibiotics on mortality. This is an update of a Cochrane
              review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
              effectiveness and safety of granulocyte transfusions compared to
              no granulocyte transfusions as adjuncts to antimicrobials for
              treating infections in people with neutropenia or disorders of
              neutrophil function aimed at reducing mortality and other adverse
              outcomes related to infection. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for
              randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central
              Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library
              2016, Issue 2). MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL
              (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980) and
              ongoing trial databases to 11 February 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA:
              RCTs comparing people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil
              dysfunction receiving granulocyte transfusions to treat infection
              with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions.
              Neonates are the subject of another Cochrane review and were
              excluded from this review. There was no restriction by outcomes
              examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND
              ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by
              the Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 trials
              that met the inclusion criteria with a total of 587 participants.
              We also identified another ongoing trial. These trials were
              conducted between 1975 and 2015. None of the studies included
              people with neutrophil dysfunction. The studies differed in the
              type of infections they included. Six studies included both
              children and adults, however data were not reported separately
              for children and adults. The two newest studies gave granulocyte
              colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to donors; both were stopped
              early due to lack of recruitment. Three studies re-randomised
              participants and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be
              performed.Overall the quality of the evidence was very low to low
              across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This
              was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and
              many of the outcomes being imprecise.There may be no difference
              in all-cause mortality over 30 days between participants
              receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did
              not (six studies; 321 participants; RR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.54 to
              1.04; very low-quality evidence). There were no differences
              between the granulocyte dose subgroups (< 1 x 10(10) per day
              versus $\geq$ 1 x 10(10) per day) (test for subgroup differences
              P = 0.39). There was a difference in all-cause mortality between
              the studies based on the age of the study (published before 2000
              versus published 2000 or later) (test for subgroup differences P
              = 0.03). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between
              participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and those that
              did not in the newest study (one study; 111 participants; RR
              1.10, 95\% CI 0.70 to 1.73, low-quality evidence). There may be a
              reduction in all-cause mortality in participants receiving
              granulocyte transfusions compared to those that did not in
              studies published before the year 2000 (five studies; 210
              participants; RR 0.53, 95\% CI 0.33 to 0.85; low-quality
              evidence).There may be no difference in clinical reversal of
              concurrent infection between participants receiving therapeutic
              granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (five studies;
              286 participants; RR 0.98, 95\% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low-quality
              evidence).There is insufficient evidence to determine whether
              there is a difference in pulmonary serious adverse events (1
              study; 24 participants; RR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.38 to 1.88; very
              low-quality evidence).None of the studies reported number of days
              on therapeutic antibiotics, number of adverse events requiring
              discontinuation of treatment, or quality of life.Six studies
              reported their funding sources and all were funded by governments
              or charities. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In people who are neutropenic
              due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem
              cell transplant, there is insufficient evidence to determine
              whether granulocyte transfusions affect all-cause mortality. To
              be able to detect a decrease in all-cause mortality from 35\% to
              30\% would require a study containing at least 2748 participants
              (80\% power, 5\% significance). There is low-grade evidence that
              therapeutic granulocyte transfusions may not increase the number
              of participants with clinical resolution of an infection.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: People with haematological disorders are frequently
              at risk of severe or life-threatening bleeding as a result of
              thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count). This is despite the
              routine use of prophylactic platelet transfusions to prevent
              bleeding once the platelet count falls below a certain threshold.
              Platelet transfusions are not without risk and adverse events may
              be life-threatening. A possible adjunct to prophylactic platelet
              transfusions is the use of antifibrinolytics, specifically the
              lysine analogues tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon aminocaproic
              acid (EACA). This is an update of a Cochrane review first
              published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and
              safety of antifibrinolytics (lysine analogues) in preventing
              bleeding in people with haematological disorders. SEARCH METHODS:
              We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the
              Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane
              Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974),
              CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950)
              and ongoing trial databases to 07 March 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA:
              We included RCTs involving participants with haematological
              disorders, who would routinely require prophylactic platelet
              transfusions to prevent bleeding. We only included trials
              involving the use of the lysine analogues TXA and EACA. DATA
              COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
              screened all electronically-derived citations and abstracts of
              papers, identified by the review search strategy, for relevancy.
              Two review authors independently assessed the full text of all
              potentially relevant trials for eligibility, completed the data
              extraction and assessed the studies for risk of bias using The
              Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. We requested
              missing data from one author but the data were no longer
              available. The outcomes are reported narratively: we performed no
              meta-analyses because of the heterogeneity of the available data.
              MAIN RESULTS: We identified three new studies in this update of
              the review. In total seven studies were eligible for inclusion,
              three were ongoing RCTs and four were completed studies. The four
              completed studies were included in the original review and the
              three ongoing studies were included in this update. We did not
              identify any RCTs that compared TXA with EACA.Of the four
              completed studies, one cross-over TXA study (eight participants)
              was excluded from the outcome analysis because it had very flawed
              study methodology. Data from the other three studies were all at
              unclear risk of bias due to lack of reporting of study
              methodology.Three studies (two TXA (12 to 56 participants), one
              EACA (18 participants) reported in four articles (published 1983
              to 1995) were included in the narrative review. All three studies
              compared the drug with placebo. All three studies included adults
              with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy. One study (12
              participants) only included participants with acute promyelocytic
              leukaemia. None of the studies included children. One of the
              three studies reported funding sources and this study was funded
              by a charity.We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics reduce
              the risk of bleeding (three studies; 86 participants; very
              low-quality evidence). Only one study reported the number of
              bleeding events per participant and there was no difference in
              the number of bleeding events seen during induction or
              consolidation chemotherapy between TXA and placebo (induction; 38
              participants; mean difference (MD) 1.70 bleeding events, 95\%
              confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to 3.77: consolidation; 18
              participants; MD -1.50 bleeding events, 95\% CI -3.25 to 0.25;
              very low-quality evidence). The two other studies suggested
              bleeding was reduced in the antifibrinolytic study arm, but this
              was statistically significant in only one of these two
              studies.Two studies reported thromboembolism and no events
              occurred (68 participants, very low-quality evidence).All three
              studies reported a reduction in platelet transfusion usage (three
              studies, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence), but this
              was reported in different ways and no meta-analysis could be
              performed. No trials reported the number of platelet transfusions
              per participant. Only one study reported the number of platelet
              components per participant and there was a reduction in the
              number of platelet components per participant during
              consolidation chemotherapy but not during induction chemotherapy
              (consolidation; 18 participants; MD -5.60 platelet units, 95\% CI
              -9.02 to -2.18: induction; 38 participants, MD -1.00 platelet
              units, 95\% CI -9.11 to 7.11; very low-quality evidence).Only one
              study reported adverse events of TXA as an outcome measure and
              none occurred. One study stated side effects of EACA were minimal
              but no further information was provided (two studies, 74
              participants, very low-quality evidence).None of the studies
              reported on the following pre-specified outcomes: overall
              mortality, adverse events of transfusion, disseminated
              intravascular coagulation (DIC) or quality of life (QoL).
              AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the evidence
              available for the use of antifibrinolytics in haematology
              patients is very limited. The trials were too small to assess
              whether or not antifibrinolytics decrease bleeding. No trials
              reported the number of platelet transfusions per participant. The
              trials were too small to assess whether or not antifibrinolytics
              increased the risk of thromboembolic events or other adverse
              events. There are three ongoing RCTs (1276 participants) due to
              be completed in 2017 and 2020.",

              practice to prevent and treat bleeding in thrombocytopenic
              patients with bone marrow failure. Although considerable advances
              have been made in platelet transfusion therapy in the last 40
              years, some areas continue to provoke debate, especially
              concerning the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the
              prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding.This is an update of a
              Cochrane review first published in 2004 and updated in 2012 that
              addressed four separate questions: therapeutic-only versus
              prophylactic platelet transfusion policy; prophylactic platelet
              transfusion threshold; prophylactic platelet transfusion dose;
              and platelet transfusions compared to alternative treatments. We
              have now split this review into four smaller reviews looking at
              these questions individually; this review is the first part of
              the original review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a
              therapeutic-only platelet transfusion policy (platelet
              transfusions given when patient bleeds) is as effective and safe
              as a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (platelet
              transfusions given to prevent bleeding, usually when the platelet
              count falls below a given trigger level) in patients with
              haematological disorders undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy
              or stem cell transplantation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for
              randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central
              Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 6),
              MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the
              Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950) and ongoing trial
              databases to 23 July 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs involving
              transfusions of platelet concentrates prepared either from
              individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to
              prevent or treat bleeding in patients with malignant
              haematological disorders receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy
              or undergoing HSCT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used
              standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane
              Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: We identified seven RCTs that
              compared therapeutic platelet transfusions to prophylactic
              platelet transfusions in haematology patients undergoing
              myelosuppressive chemotherapy or HSCT. One trial is still
              ongoing, leaving six trials eligible with a total of 1195
              participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2013
              and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient
              populations. We were able to critically appraise five of these
              studies, which contained separate data for each arm, and were
              unable to perform quantitative analysis on one study that did not
              report the numbers of participants in each treatment arm.Overall
              the quality of evidence per outcome was low to moderate according
              to the GRADE approach. None of the included studies were at low
              risk of bias in every domain, and all the studies identified had
              some threats to validity. We deemed only one study to be at low
              risk of bias in all domains other than blinding.Two RCTs (801
              participants) reported at least one bleeding episode within 30
              days of the start of the study. We were unable to perform a
              meta-analysis due to considerable statistical heterogeneity
              between studies. The statistical heterogeneity seen may relate to
              the different methods used in studies for the assessment and
              grading of bleeding. The underlying patient diagnostic and
              treatment categories also appeared to have some effect on
              bleeding risk. Individually these studies showed a similar
              effect, that a therapeutic-only platelet transfusion strategy was
              associated with an increased risk of clinically significant
              bleeding compared with a prophylactic platelet transfusion
              policy. Number of days with a clinically significant bleeding
              event per participant was higher in the therapeutic-only group
              than in the prophylactic group (one RCT; 600 participants; mean
              difference 0.50, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.90;
              moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to
              determine whether there was any difference in the number of
              participants with severe or life-threatening bleeding between a
              therapeutic-only transfusion policy and a prophylactic platelet
              transfusion policy (two RCTs; 801 participants; risk ratio (RR)
              4.91, 95\% CI 0.86 to 28.12; low-quality evidence). Two RCTs (801
              participants) reported time to first bleeding episode. As there
              was considerable heterogeneity between the studies, we were
              unable to perform a meta-analysis. Both studies individually
              found that time to first bleeding episode was shorter in the
              therapeutic-only group compared with the prophylactic platelet
              transfusion group.There was insufficient evidence to determine
              any difference in all-cause mortality within 30 days of the start
              of the study using a therapeutic-only platelet transfusion policy
              compared with a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (two
              RCTs; 629 participants). Mortality was a rare event, and
              therefore larger studies would be needed to establish the effect
              of these alternative strategies. There was a clear reduction in
              the number of platelet transfusions per participant in the
              therapeutic-only arm (two RCTs, 991 participants; standardised
              mean reduction of 0.50 platelet transfusions per participant,
              95\% CI -0.63 to -0.37; moderate-quality evidence). None of the
              studies reported quality of life. There was no evidence of any
              difference in the frequency of adverse events, such as
              transfusion reactions, between a therapeutic-only and
              prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (two RCTs; 991
              participants; RR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.62 to 1.68), although the
              confidence intervals were wide. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found
              low- to moderate-grade evidence that a therapeutic-only platelet
              transfusion policy is associated with increased risk of bleeding
              when compared with a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy in
              haematology patients who are thrombocytopenic due to
              myelosuppressive chemotherapy or HSCT. There is insufficient
              evidence to determine any difference in mortality rates and no
              evidence of any difference in adverse events between a
              therapeutic-only platelet transfusion policy and a prophylactic
              platelet transfusion policy. A therapeutic-only platelet
              transfusion policy is associated with a clear reduction in the
              number of platelet components administered.",

              are safe and effective at preventing bleeding. SEARCH METHODS: We
              searched 11 bibliographic databases and four ongoing trials
              databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
              Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 1946 to 19 May
              2016), Embase (OvidSP, 1974 to 19 May 2016), PubMed
              (e-publications only: searched 19 May 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov,
              World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and the ISRCTN Register

              randomised controlled trials in people with haematological

              platelet transfusion (artificial platelet substitutes,
              platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant
              activated factor VII, desmopressin (DDAVP), or thrombopoietin
              (TPO) mimetics) or a comparator (placebo, standard care or
              platelet transfusion). We excluded studies of antifibrinolytic
              drugs, as they were the focus of another review. DATA COLLECTION
              AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened all electronically
              derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the
              review search strategy. Two review authors assessed risk of bias
              in the included studies and extracted data independently. MAIN
              RESULTS: We identified 16 eligible trials. Four trials are
              ongoing and two have been completed but the results have not yet
              been published (trial completion dates: April 2012 to February
              2017). Therefore, the review included 10 trials in eight
              references with 554 participants. Six trials (336 participants)
              only included participants with acute myeloid leukaemia
              undergoing intensive chemotherapy, two trials (38 participants)
              included participants with lymphoma undergoing intensive
              chemotherapy and two trials (180 participants) reported
              participants undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Men
              and women were equally well represented in the trials. The age
              range of participants included in the trials was from 16 years to
              81 years. All trials took place in high-income countries. The
              manufacturers of the agent sponsored eight trials that were under
              investigation, and two trials did not report their source of
              funding.No trials assessed artificial platelet substitutes,
              fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII or
              desmopressin.Nine trials compared a TPO mimetic to placebo or
              standard care; seven of these used pegylated recombinant human
              megakaryocyte growth and differentiation factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) and
              two used recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO).One trial
              compared platelet-poor plasma to platelet transfusion.We
              considered that all the trials included in this review were at
              high risk of bias and meta-analysis was not possible in seven
              trials due to problems with the way data were reported.We are
              very uncertain whether TPO mimetics reduce the number of
              participants with any bleeding episode (odds ratio (OR) 0.40,
              95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 1.62, one trial, 120
              participants, very low quality evidence). We are very uncertain
              whether TPO mimetics reduce the risk of a life-threatening bleed
              after 30 days (OR 1.46, 95\% CI 0.06 to 33.14, three trials, 209
              participants, very low quality evidence); or after 90 days (OR
              1.00, 95\% CI 0.06 to 16.37, one trial, 120 participants, very
              low quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether TPO mimetics
              reduce platelet transfusion requirements after 30 days (mean
              difference -3.00 units, 95\% CI -5.39 to -0.61, one trial, 120
              participants, very low quality evidence). No deaths occurred in
              either group after 30 days (one trial, 120 participants, very low
              quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether TPO mimetics
              reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days (OR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.24 to
              4.20, one trial, 120 participants, very low quality evidence). No
              thromboembolic events occurred for participants treated with TPO
              mimetics or control at 30 days (two trials, 209 participants,
              very low quality evidence). We found no trials that looked at:
              number of days on which bleeding occurred, time from
              randomisation to first bleed or quality of life.One trial with 18
              participants compared platelet-poor plasma transfusion with
              platelet transfusion. We are very uncertain whether platelet-poor
              plasma reduces the number of participants with any bleeding
              episode (OR 16.00, 95\% CI 1.32 to 194.62, one trial, 18
              participants, very low quality evidence). We are very uncertain
              whether platelet-poor plasma reduces the number of participants
              with severe or life-threatening bleeding (OR 4.00, 95\% CI 0.56
              to 28.40, one trial, 18 participants, very low quality evidence).
              We found no trials that looked at: number of days on which
              bleeding occurred, time from randomisation to first bleed, number
              of platelet transfusions, all-cause mortality, thromboembolic
              events or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is
              insufficient evidence to determine if platelet-poor plasma or TPO
              mimetics reduce bleeding for participants with haematological
              malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy or stem cell
              transplantation. To detect a decrease in the proportion of
              participants with clinically significant bleeding from 12 in 100
              to 6 in 100 would require a trial containing at least 708
              participants (80\% power, 5\% significance). The six ongoing
              trials will provide additional information about the TPO mimetic
              comparison (424 participants) but this will still be underpowered
              to demonstrate this level of reduction in bleeding. None of the
              included or ongoing trials include children. There are no
              completed or ongoing trials assessing artificial platelet
              substitutes, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor
              VII or desmopressin in people undergoing intensive chemotherapy

              practice to prevent and treat bleeding in people who are
              thrombocytopenic due to bone marrow failure. Although
              considerable advances have been made in platelet transfusion
              therapy in the last 40 years, some areas continue to provoke
              debate, especially concerning the use of prophylactic platelet
              transfusions for the prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding.This
              is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and
              previously updated in 2012 that addressed four separate
              questions: prophylactic versus therapeutic-only platelet
              transfusion policy; prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold;
              prophylactic platelet transfusion dose; and platelet transfusions
              compared to alternative treatments. This review has now been
              split into four smaller reviews looking at these questions
              individually; this review compares prophylactic platelet
              transfusion thresholds. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether
              different platelet transfusion thresholds for administration of
              prophylactic platelet transfusions (platelet transfusions given
              to prevent bleeding) affect the efficacy and safety of
              prophylactic platelet transfusions in preventing bleeding in
              people with haematological disorders undergoing myelosuppressive
              chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
              SEARCH METHODS: We searched for randomised controlled trials
              (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
              (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 6, 23 July 2015), MEDLINE
              (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the
              Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial
              databases to 23 July 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs
              involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either
              from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given
              to prevent bleeding in people with haematological disorders
              (receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or undergoing HSCT) that
              compared different thresholds for administration of prophylactic
              platelet transfusions (low trigger (5 x 10(9)/L); standard
              trigger (10 x 10(9)/L); higher trigger (20 x 10(9)/L, 30 x
              10(9)/L, 50 x 10(9)/L); or alternative platelet trigger (for
              example platelet mass)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used
              the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN
              RESULTS: Three trials met our predefined inclusion criteria and
              were included for analysis in the review (499 participants). All
              three trials compared a standard trigger (10 x 10(9)/L) versus a
              higher trigger (20 x 10(9)/L or 30 x 10(9)/L). None of the trials
              compared a low trigger versus a standard trigger or an
              alternative platelet trigger. The trials were conducted between
              1991 and 2001 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable
              patient populations.The original review contained four trials
              (658 participants); in the previous update of this review we
              excluded one trial (159 participants) because fewer than 80\% of
              participants had a haematological disorder. We identified no new
              trials in this update of the review.Overall, the methodological
              quality of the studies was low across different outcomes
              according to GRADE methodology. None of the included studies were
              at low risk of bias in every domain, and all the included studies
              had some threats to validity.Three studies reported the number of
              participants with at least one clinically significant bleeding
              episode within 30 days from the start of the study. There was no
              evidence of a difference in the number of participants with a
              clinically significant bleeding episode between the standard and
              higher trigger groups (three studies; 499 participants; risk
              ratio (RR) 1.35, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.90;
              low-quality evidence).One study reported the number of days with
              a clinically significant bleeding event (adjusted for repeated
              measures). There was no evidence of a difference in the number of
              days of bleeding per participant between the standard and higher
              trigger groups (one study; 255 participants; relative proportion
              of days with World Health Organization Grade 2 or worse bleeding
              (RR 1.71, 95\% CI 0.84 to 3.48, P = 0.162; authors' own results;
              low-quality evidence).Two studies reported the number of
              participants with severe or life-threatening bleeding. There was
              no evidence of any difference in the number of participants with
              severe or life-threatening bleeding between a standard trigger
              level and a higher trigger level (two studies; 421 participants;
              RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.52 to 1.88; low-quality evidence).Only one
              study reported the time to first bleeding episode. There was no
              evidence of any difference in the time to the first bleeding
              episode between a standard trigger level and a higher trigger
              level (one study; 255 participants; hazard ratio 1.11, 95\% CI
              0.64 to 1.91; low-quality evidence).Only one study reported on
              all-cause mortality within 30 days from the start of the study.
              There was no evidence of any difference in all-cause mortality
              between standard and higher trigger groups (one study; 255
              participants; RR 1.78, 95\% CI 0.83 to 3.81; low-quality
              evidence).Three studies reported on the number of platelet
              transfusions per participant. Two studies reported on the mean
              number of platelet transfusions per participant. There was a
              significant reduction in the number of platelet transfusions per
              participant in the standard trigger group (two studies, mean
              difference -2.09, 95\% CI -3.20 to -0.99; low-quality
              evidence).One study reported on the number of transfusion
              reactions. There was no evidence to demonstrate any difference in
              transfusion reactions between the standard and higher trigger
              groups (one study; 79 participants; RR 0.07, 95\% CI 0.00 to
              1.09).None of the studies reported on quality of life. AUTHORS'
              CONCLUSIONS: In people with haematological disorders who are
              thrombocytopenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or HSCT, we
              found low-quality evidence that a standard trigger level (10 x
              10(9)/L) is associated with no increase in the risk of bleeding
              when compared to a higher trigger level (20 x 10(9)/L or 30 x
              10(9)/L). There was low-quality evidence that a standard trigger
              level is associated with a decreased number of transfusion
              episodes when compared to a higher trigger level (20 x 10(9)/L or
              30 x 10(9)/L).Findings from this review were based on three
              studies and 499 participants. Without further evidence, it is
              reasonable to continue with the current practice of administering
              prophylactic platelet transfusions using the standard trigger
              level (10 x 10(9)/L) in the absence of other risk factors for
              bleeding.",

              SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials involving
              transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from
              individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to
              prevent bleeding in people with malignant haematological
              disorders or undergoing HSCT that compared different platelet

              methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
              MAIN RESULTS: We included seven trials (1814 participants) in
              this review; six were conducted during one course of treatment
              (chemotherapy or HSCT).Overall the methodological quality of
              studies was low to moderate across different outcomes according
              to GRADE methodology. None of the included studies were at low
              risk of bias in every domain, and all the included studies had

              difference in the number of participants with a clinically
              significant bleeding episode between the low-dose and
              standard-dose groups (four studies; 1170 participants; risk ratio
              (RR) 1.04, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.13;
              moderate-quality evidence); low-dose and high-dose groups (one
              study; 849 participants; RR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.11;
              moderate-quality evidence); or high-dose and standard-dose groups

              moderate-quality evidence).Three studies reported the number of
              days with a clinically significant bleeding event per
              participant. There was no difference in the number of days of
              bleeding per participant between the low-dose and standard-dose
              groups (two studies; 230 participants; mean difference -0.17,
              95\% CI -0.51 to 0.17; low quality evidence). One study (855
              participants) showed no difference in the number of days of
              bleeding per participant between high-dose and standard-dose
              groups, or between low-dose and high-dose groups (849
              participants).Three studies reported the number of participants
              with severe or life-threatening bleeding. There was no difference
              in the number of participants with severe or life-threatening
              bleeding between a low-dose and a standard-dose platelet
              transfusion policy (three studies; 1059 participants; RR 1.33,
              95\% CI 0.91 to 1.92; low-quality evidence); low-dose and
              high-dose groups (one study; 849 participants; RR 1.20, 95\% CI
              0.82 to 1.77; low-quality evidence); or high-dose and
              standard-dose groups (one study; 855 participants; RR 1.11, 95\%
              CI 0.73 to 1.68; low-quality evidence).Two studies reported the
              time to first bleeding episodes; we were unable to perform a
              meta-analysis. Both studies (959 participants) individually found
              that the time to first bleeding episode was either the same, or
              longer, in the low-dose group compared to the standard-dose
              group. One study (855 participants) found that the time to the
              first bleeding episode was the same in the high-dose group
              compared to the standard-dose group.Three studies reported
              all-cause mortality within 30 days from the start of the study.
              There was no difference in all-cause mortality between treatment
              arms (low-dose versus standard-dose: three studies; 1070
              participants; RR 2.04, 95\% CI 0.70 to 5.93; low-quality
              evidence; low-dose versus high-dose: one study; 849 participants;
              RR 1.33, 95\% CI 0.50 to 3.54; low-quality evidence; and
              high-dose versus standard-dose: one study; 855 participants; RR
              1.71, 95\% CI 0.51 to 5.81; low-quality evidence).Six studies
              reported the number of platelet transfusions; we were unable to
              perform a meta-analysis. Two studies (959 participants) out of
              three (1070 participants) found that a low-dose transfusion
              strategy led to more transfusion episodes than a standard-dose.
              One study (849 participants) found that a low-dose transfusion
              strategy led to more transfusion episodes than a high-dose
              strategy. One study (855 participants) out of three (1007
              participants) found no difference in the number of platelet
              transfusions between the high-dose and standard-dose groups.One
              study reported on transfusion reactions. This study's authors
              suggested that a high-dose platelet transfusion strategy may lead
              to a higher rate of transfusion-related adverse events.None of
              the studies reported quality-of-life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In
              haematology patients who are thrombocytopenic due to
              myelosuppressive chemotherapy or HSCT, we found no evidence to
              suggest that a low-dose platelet transfusion policy is associated
              with an increased bleeding risk compared to a standard-dose or
              high-dose policy, or that a high-dose platelet transfusion policy
              is associated with a decreased risk of bleeding when compared to
              a standard-dose policy.A low-dose platelet transfusion strategy
              leads to an increased number of transfusion episodes compared to
              a standard-dose strategy. A high-dose platelet transfusion
              strategy does not decrease the number of transfusion episodes per
              participant compared to a standard-dose regimen, and it may
              increase the number of transfusion-related adverse
              events.Findings from this review would suggest a change from
              current practice, with low-dose platelet transfusions used for
              people receiving in-patient treatment for their haematological
              disorder and high-dose platelet transfusion strategies not being
              used routinely.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Individuals on continuous treatment with vitamin K
              antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at
              increased risk of bleeding complications during and after oral or
              dental procedures. Anticoagulant treatment is preferably
              continued at the same dose, since dose reduction or
              discontinuation of treatment is associated with an increased risk
              of thromboembolism. The use of haemostatic measures during or
              after the procedure (or both) could enable continuation of the
              oral anticoagulant treatment. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the
              efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents for preventing bleeding
              complications in people on oral anticoagulants undergoing minor
              oral surgery or dental extractions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched
              the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Coagulopathies
              Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and
              handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also
              searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We
              searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Additional
              searches were performed using ClinicalTrials.gov, the
              International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the
              CINAHL database of nursing and allied health services, the open
              access ProQuest dissertation database, papers and reports from
              the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) and abstract
              books from annual scientific conferences.Date of last search: 04
              January 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised
              controlled trials in people on continuous treatment with VKAs or
              DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures using antifibrinolytic
              agents (tranexamic acid (TXA) or epsilon aminocaproic acid) to
              prevent perioperative bleeding compared to no intervention or
              usual care with or without placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
              Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of
              all identified articles. Full texts were obtained from
              potentially relevant abstracts and two authors independently
              assessed these for inclusion based of the selection criteria. A
              third author verified trial eligibility. Two authors
              independently performed data extraction and risk of bias
              assessments using standardized forms. The quality of the evidence
              was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: No eligible trials in
              people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or
              dental procedures were identified.Three randomised trials and one
              quasi-randomised trial (follow-up in all was seven days) in
              people on continuous treatment with VKAs were included with a
              total of 253 participants (mean age 60 years). Two trials
              published in 1989 and 1993 compared the antifibrinolytic agent
              TXA with placebo in people using VKAs. Two other trials were
              published in 1999 and 2015 and compared TXA with gelatin sponge
              and sutures, and dry gauze compression, respectively. In all
              included trials, those who were treated with VKAs had
              international normalised ratio (INR) values within the
              therapeutic range and TXA was applied locally, not
              systemically.The two trials from 1989 and 1993 comparing TXA with
              placebo showed a statistically significant beneficial effect
              regarding the number of major postoperative bleeding episodes
              requiring intervention, with a pooled risk difference (RD) of
              -0.25 (95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.36 to -0.14) (128
              participants) (moderate-quality evidence). For the two trials
              that compared TXA with either gelatin sponge and sutures or with
              dry gauze compression, there was no difference between the TXA
              and the standard care group, RD 0.02 (95\% CI -0.07 to 0.11) (125
              participants) (moderate-quality evidence). The combined RD of all
              included trials was -0.13 (95\% CI -0.30 to 0.05)
              (moderate-quality evidence). There were no side effects of
              antifibrinolytic therapy that required treatment withdrawal (128
              participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Despite heterogeneity
              between trials with respect to the different haemostatic measures
              used in the control groups, the trials were comparable regarding
              design and baseline participant characteristics.Overall, we
              considered the risk of bias to be low in the trials comparing TXA
              with placebo and moderate in the trials comparing TXA with
              alternative haemostatic measures. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on
              the results of this Cochrane Review, there seems to be a
              beneficial effect of locally applied TXA in preventing oral
              bleeding in people on continuous treatment with VKAs undergoing
              minor oral surgery or dental extractions. However, the small
              number of identified randomised controlled trials, the relatively
              small number of participants included in the trials and the
              differences in standard therapy and treatment regimens between
              trials, do not allow us to conclude definite efficacy of
              antifibrinolytic therapy in this population.We were unable to
              identify any eligible trials in people on continuous treatment
              with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures. Therefore, a
              beneficial effect of antifibrinolytic therapy can currently only
              be assumed based on data from the people using VKAs.",

              disease, disease-related complications, and therapy in multiple
              myeloma (MM). In patients with hematologic tumors, impaired
              fibrinolysis may be present and may contribute to the development
              of thrombotic complications. Therefore, we designed a study to
              investigate fibrinolytic activity in MM. We compared plasma
              levels of interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-1beta,
              IL-11, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, plasminogen
              activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity, and global fibrinolytic
              capacity (GFC) in patients with MM (n = 66) and in control
              subjects (n = 18). The prevalence of venous thromboembolism was
              4.5\%, with a median follow-up period of 7 months in our myeloma
              group. Results are given as mean (median, range). Plasma levels
              of IL-6 (8.27 +/- 0.74 [9.65, 0.90-13.32] pg/mL versus 2.64 +/-

              mg/L, P < 0.001), PAI-1 (7.40 +/- 0.67 [5.57, 2.40-31.80] IU/mL

              score (1.90 +/- 0.02 [2, 1-3] versus 2.50 +/- 0.14 [3, 1-3], P <
              0.001) were increased compared with controls. In patients with
              MM, the level of IL-6 was positively correlated with CRP (r =
              0.66, P < 0.001), IL-1beta (r = 0.29, P < 0.05), and PAI-1 (r =
              0.35, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with GFC (r = -0.37, P
              < 0.01). CRP level was positively correlated with plasma PAI-1
              level (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with GFC (r
              = -0.44, P < 0.001). A significant negative correlation between
              PAI-1 level and GFC (r = -0.75, P < 0.001) was also detected.
              IL-1beta levels were negatively correlated with tPA level (r =
              -0.26, P < 0.05). These results suggest that patients with
              myeloma have a decreased fibrinolytic activity mainly because of
              increased PAI-1 activity. In MM, increased PAI-1 activity seems
              to be related with elevated IL-6 level. MM should be considered
              as a hypercoagulable state as a result of both increased
              procoagulant activity and decreased fibrinolytic activity.
              Achieving a plateau by means of conventional chemotherapies does
              not improve the decreased fibrinolytic activity.",

              from reduced synthesis of proteins such as antithrombin III.
              Hypofibrinogenemia, also a side effect, may be a marker of
              thrombosis and decreased protein synthesis. A retrospective chart

              thrombocytopenia with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia
              and myelodysplastic syndrome (FPD/[DD1] AML, MIM 601399). Despite
              its low incidence, the high risk of malignant transformation
              (around 35\% lifetime risk) makes it A clinically relevant and
              important diagnosis. Case presentation: A two year old female
              presented with A lifelong history of bruising on the knees, shin,
              face and buttocks (ISTH-BAT score of 3). Family history was
              notable for reported bruising in the mother and minimal bruising
              typical for age in the younger brother, but no other family
              history of significant bruising, bleeding, known platelet
              disorders, MDS, AML or other hematologic malignancies. Screening
              coagulation studies (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, thrombin time and von
              Willebrand Factor profile) were normal. Platelet count ranged
              between 160 and 191 x 10^3/$\mu$ L. Lumiaggregometry to evaluate
              for A possible platelet function disorder showed normal
              aggregation but decreased ATP release in response to thrombin and
              arachidonic acid, normal aggregation and absent release to ADP,
              decreased aggregation to collagen and normal aggregation with
              ristocetin. Platelet transmission electron microscopy study
              demonstrated moderately decreased mean dense granules per
              platelet. The findings were compatible with storage pool disorder
              or A platelet metabolic defect. Next generation sequencing of A
              panel of 44 genes known to cause platelet disorders identified A
              likely pathogenic germline RUNX1 variant (c.499A>C; p.Ser167Arg)
              affecting the runt domain (DNA binding domain). Family studies
              showed this variant to be absent in the proband's mother, father,
              and younger brother, suggesting de novo occurence. Discussion:
              FPD/AML is usually diagnosed in patients with lifelong
              thrombocytopenia with mild to moderate bleeding and A personal or
              family history of myeloid neoplasms. However, heterogeneity in
              the clinical phenotype exists, with some patients presenting with
              A low-normal platelet count, variable bleeding, and risk of
              malignant clonal evolution in individual families. At the
              platelet functional and ultrastructural level, storage pool
              disorder with decreased dense granule content and release has
              been described. This explains why, compared to other autosomal
              dominant nonsyndromic thrombocytopenias with normal platelet size
              (such as ANKRD26-and ETV6-related disorders), patients with
              FPD/AML may have more clinically significant bleeding. This case
              highlights the variability in the clinical and laboratory
              phenotype of FPD/AML and the importance of recognizing the
              functional platelet defect caused by germline RUNX1 mutations
              when evaluating A patient with mild to moderate mucocutaneous
              bleeding suspected to have an inherited cause. Given the
              associated risk of malignancy, A prompt and accurate diagnosis is
              key for surveillance of malignant transformation, genetic
              counseling, and identification of other at-risk family members.",

              studied whether in vitro platelet function predicts future
              bleeding in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and
              thrombocytopenia. Adult AML patients with platelet count <5.0
              $\times$ 1010 /L were included. Detailed bleeding history and
              blood samples were collected at inclusion and every 7 days. We
              analyzed hematology and coagulation parameters. With flow
              cytometry we evaluated platelet activation (activated GPIIb/IIIa,
              P-selectin, and CD63 expression), and platelet aggregation.
              Agonists were thrombin-receptor activating peptide (TRAP) and
              collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL). During 18 months, sixty
              participants were enrolled and followed for a total of 114 weeks.
              Bleeding occurred in 52 weeks, and was not associated with
              clinical, hematology or coagulation parameters. Predictors of
              bleeding were assessed using multivariate logistic regression,
              adjusted for platelet count, sex, and age. Bleeding history and
              receiver operating curves were compared using c-index. Reduced
              TRAP-induced platelet aggregation had Odds ratio 3.00 (95\%
              confidence interval [CI] 1.38-6.60). Reduced CRP-XL-induced
              platelet aggregation had Odds ratio 4.00 (95\%-CI 1.70-9.20) for
              bleeding. Overall, C-index was 0.71 for the models including
              platelet aggregation results, 0.72 for activated
              GPIIb/IIIa-positive platelets after stimulation with TRAP, 0.68
              for percent P-selectin positive platelets with TRAP and 0.63 for
              the platelet count. Among patients receiving no platelet
              transfusion, C-index was 0.83-0.91 for bleeding; highest for

  abstract = "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by
              proliferation of morphologically abnormal promyelocytes and a
              severe bleeding diathesis. The abnormal promyelocyte is
              characterized by abundant, large granules, many of which are
              spindle-shaped. Electron microscopic appearance of the granules
              closely resembles that of Auer rods. The granules appear to
              possess tissue thromboplastin activity by both immunologic and
              clotting assays. Coagulation studies in APL are generally
              consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation.
              Prolongation of the prothrombin time and elevation of fibrinogen
              degradation products are the tests that are most commonly
              abnormal. Although occasional reports indicate a favorable
              response of the coagulopathy to drugs that inhibit fibrinolysis,
              the use of prophylactic heparin appears to be the treatment of
              choice. The response rate of APL to chemotherapy regimens that
              contain an anthracycline is comparable to that of acute
              myelogenous leukemia. The recent description of the 15;17
              chromosomal translocation which may be pathognomonic for APL is
              only the second example of a chromosomal marker of human
              neoplasia. Marked elevation of serum vitamin B12 and B12 binding
              proteins appears to be another characteristic feature of APL. An
              in vitro cell line of APL cells has been demonstrated to have the

              morbidity and mortality in early induction. Patients who failed
              to achieve remission were older and more often had pulmonary
              leukostasis (62\% vs 23\%, p = .01) and hepatomegaly (54\% vs
              31\%, p = .06) at presentation. Thirty-seven patients (44\%) did
              not achieve complete remission (CR); 17 (54\%) died early in
              induction therapy, 11 directly as a result of pulmonary
              hemorrhage with respiratory failure, while 5 had both pulmonary
              hemorrhage with respiratory failure and CNS hemorrhage. Early
              death patients were older and more often had pulmonary

              leukapheresis was not employed as often in this very-high-risk
              group as in other patients (56\% vs 82\%, respectively). Thus,
              sufficient heterogeneity exists in patients presenting with HL to
              define a subset of patients at particularly high risk for early
              mortality. Preinduction leukapheresis applied in a prospective
              controlled fashion should be evaluated to assess if such
              treatment may decrease early mortality in this group.",

  abstract = "Hemostatic abnormalities are present in a majority of patients
              with metastatic cancer. These abnormalities can be categorized as
              1) increased platelet aggregation and activation, 2) abnormal
              activation of coagulation cascade, 3) release of plasminogen
              activator, and 4) decreased hepatic synthesis of anticoagulant
              proteins like Protein C and antithrombin III. The abnormal
              activation of coagulation cascade is mediated through release of
              Tissue Factor, Factor X activators, and other miscellaneous
              procoagulants from the plasma membrane vesicles of tumor cells.
              Macrophages of a tumor-bearing host also produce increased
              amounts of Tissue Factor. Production of Factor X activators and
              macrophage Tissue Factor is decreased by warfarin. The ability of
              the tumor cells to produce platelet-aggregating activity and
              plasminogen activator parallels their metastatic potential in
              animal and experimental systems. These studies also show that
              antiplatelet agents and antibodies against plasminogen activator
              can suppress the metastatic process. One or more laboratory
              abnormalities of hemostasis can be shown in up to 95\% of
              patients with metastatic cancer. These abnormalities, however,
              are unable to predict subsequent development of thromboembolic or
              hemorrhagic complications. Clinical complications occur in 9-15\%
              of the patients in the form of thrombotic or hemorrhagic
              disorders. The therapy of tumor-related coagulopathy should be
              guided by its clinical expression. Subclinical DIC should not be
              treated. Coumadin is generally ineffective for therapy of
              thrombosis in cancer patients. There is no consensus regarding
              the use of heparin in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The
              defibrination in APL may be from disseminated intravascular
              coagulation as well as systemic fibrinolysis, as shown by
              decreased alpha 2 antiplasmin levels. In such cases, epsilon

              patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 996 patients
              with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were included. After excluding
              patients diagnosed with VTE prior to or at the time of leukemia
              diagnosis, during the mean time follow-up period of 2.5 years
              (range: 0.0025-10.3 years), the overall incidence rate of VTE was

              3.4 per 100 person-years for AML. Among all patients, the
              majority (80.6\%) developed VTE within 12 months after diagnosis

               has been well described, although no formal methods for applying
               this information to clinical decisions are available. The
               authors developed a clinical prediction rule to guide the
               prophylactic use of platelet transfusions among patients with
               lymphoma or solid tumors. METHODS: The Bleeding Risk Index (BRI)
               was developed from logistic regression analysis of a randomly
               selected 750-chemotherapy cycle derivation set using data from
               Day 1 of cycles. The sensitivity and specificity of a BRI-based
               prophylaxis strategy were compared in a 512-cycle validation set
               with two strategies based on initiation of prophylaxis when
               platelet counts fell below thresholds of 20,000 per microL or
               10,000 per microL. RESULTS: Factors that were predictive of
               bleeding included any prior episode of bleeding (odds ratio
               [OR], 5.6; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 2.2-14.0),
               treatment with a drug affecting platelet function (OR, 5.1; 95\%
               CI, 2.0-12.6), bone marrow metastases (OR, 4.3; 95\% CI,
               1.7-10.8), a baseline platelet count 2 (OR, 3.4; 95\% CI,
               1.4-8.5), and treatment with agents that were highly toxic to
               the bone marrow (OR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.0-5.4). Compared with
               20,000 and 10,000 platelet threshold strategies, the BRI-based
               strategy provided the best trade-off between sensitivity for
               major bleeding episodes (80\%) and specificity for any bleeding
               (84\%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lymphoma or solid tumors who
               are at high risk of bleeding can be identified reliably on Day 1
               of a chemotherapy cycle. An individualized, BRI-based approach
               to bleeding prophylaxis provides a highly sensitive and specific

              (EACA) was administered to 44 chronically (median duration, 273
              days) and severely (platelet count, 8 $\times$ 10(9)/L; range, 1
              $\times$ 10(9)/L-19 $\times$ 10(9)/L) thrombocytopenic patients
              with hematological malignancies. Prophylactic EACA at a dose of 1
              g twice daily was orally administered for a median duration of 47
              days (range, 7 days-209 days) until the platelet count recovered
              to > 30; $\times$ 10(9) /L. Platelets were only transfused if
              bleeding occurred. RESULTS: While receiving EACA, 59\% of the
              patients did not bleed, 25\% had 19 episodes of spontaneously
              resolving minor bleeding that did not require platelet

              and has therefore been described as a specific blast cell marker
              in AML M7 as well as in transient myeloproliferative disease
              (TMD) of patients with Down syndrome (DS). However, technical
              difficulties underlie the need for new markers for these

              function-associated antigen 1 (CD11a) in a large cohort of
              pediatric AML and TMD patients (n = 91) of the Austrian AML-BFM

              patients were CD11a deficient (specificity 95\%). Monocytic
              leukemias (M4/5) and normal monocytes typically showed a high

              (PBSC) mobilization in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
              and very recently in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients. Because
              prior studies have suggested that mobilization with plerixafor
              affects the composition of mobilized cells, there are concerns
              that this may in turn adversely impact the immune reconstitution
              and longer term outcomes of transplanted patients. However, data
              on the engraftment characteristics and long-term post-transplant
              outcomes in patients transplanted with plerixafor-mobilized PBSCs
              are lacking. This retrospective study examined the
              post-transplant outcomes of 105 consecutive adult HL patients,
              and compared the post-transplant outcomes of 21 patients who
              received plerixafor in addition to G-CSF $\pm$ chemotherapy
              because of poor mobilization with those of 84 patients who
              mobilized well without plerixafor. Despite collecting
              significantly lower CD34+ cell doses (median of 3.41 vs. 6.05
              $\times$ 10(6) /kg, p < 0.0001) than control patients and
              requiring more collection days, plerixafor-mobilized patients
              showed comparable early engraftment characteristics, except for
              slightly delayed neutrophil engraftment (median: 11 vs.10 days, p
              = 0.002) and lower median neutrophil counts (2.1 vs. 2.6 $\times$
              10(9) /L, p = 0.04) at one month after transplant. No significant
              differences were observed in longer term post-transplant

              poorly mobilizing HL patients to collect enough PBSCs to proceed
              to ASCT, but also to have similar post-transplant outcomes

              promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has undergone remarkable changes
              over the past three decades. Hemorrhagic complications lead to
              significant morbidity and mortality in patients with APL. Up to
              30\% of early deaths are due to hemorrhagic complications. Our
              concept of the coagulation changes in APL have evolved from a
              simple belief that the bleeding was due to disseminated
              intravascular coagulation (DIC) from underlying infection, to a
              knowledge that the APL cells themselves are responsible for the
              bleeding. We have observed that apoptotic APL cells have
              increased generation of thrombin and therefore contribute to the
              hypercoagulability and DIC. In addition, excessive fibrinolysis

              complication can have grave effects if not successfully treated,
              with a 10-20\% incidence of haemorrhagic death. We hypothesized
              that alpha-2-antiplasmin levels would correlate with the risk for
              bleeding, and that administration of epsilon-aminocaproic acid
              (EACA) would attenuate that risk. To assess this, we conducted a
              retrospective chart review analyzing 30 APML patients, 17 of whom
              were treated with EACA. Thirty patients were treated, 21 with
              primary induction therapy. Patients with low alpha-2-antiplasmin
              levels were treated with a coagulopathy protocol consisting of
              low-dose heparin, EACA and blood product support. Seventeen
              patients (57\%) developed haemorrhagic complications during their
              treatment. The presence and grade of haemorrhage appeared to be
              associated with the alpha-2-antiplasmin level. There were no
              grade IV haemorrhages or episodes of haemorrhagic death. One
              episode of central venous catheter associated thromboembolism and
              three deaths from infection during chemotherapy were observed.
              alpha-2-Antiplasmin levels are a reliable surrogate for
              fibrinolysis and haemorrhagic risk in patients with APML.
              Treatment with EACA is a rational way to pharmacologically
              inhibit fibrinolysis, is associated with a low incidence of
              severe haemorrhagic events, and appears to be safe with a low

              To further investigate whether platelets can be expected to
              adhere to and thereby affect AML blasts through their release of
              soluble mediators into a common microenvironment, we investigated
              (i) the effects on platelet activation by cytotoxic drugs
              commonly used in AML therapy; (ii) the occurrence of circulating
              activated platelets in acute leukemia patients; and (iii) the in
              vivo and in vitro adherence of platelets to AML blasts. The
              anthracyclins daunorubicin and idarubicin increased the
              expression of activation-associated membrane molecules

              in plasminogen activator included the B16 and colon 26. The Lewis
              lung and M5076 carcinoma showed an intermediate level of
              activity, while the plasminogen activator activity in the L1210
              leukemia and colon 38 was barely elevated above background. The
              specific activity of the enzyme (per micrograms protein) in
              extracts of B16 and colon 26 was three or four times higher than
              in the most active normal organs surveyed (kidney, lung, brain
              and intestine). The high level of plasminogen activator activity
              measured in extracts of the B16 tumor was reflected in a
              substantial elevation of the levels of fibrin degradation
              products in the serum of mice carrying this tumor. This result
              suggests that the tumor-associated plasminogen activator activity
              is less subject to inhibitory controls in vivo than is the
              plasminogen activator of most normal tissues, since the total
              mass of the tumor was far less than the total mass of the
              fibrinolytically active tissues, and yet the bulk of the fibrin
              degradation products were caused by the tumor. We conclude that
              the high levels of plasminogen activator activity which are
              observed in many human tumors are found only in some of the
              transplantable murine tumors. Since this enzyme is active at an
              increased level in vivo in mice carrying the B16 tumor,
              plasminogen activator may be a suitable target for selective,
              enzyme-activated chemotherapy with this tumor test system.",

              platelet adhesion to neutrophils and monocytes induced production
              of extracellular superoxide anion (O2-) by these leukocytes.
              Leukocyte membrane glycoproteins containing Ser/Thr-linked
              carbohydrate chains were responsible for the signal reception
              leading to the leukocyte activation. Cytokines were shown to
              influence these processes. For example, treatments of neutrophils
              with interleukin-8 (IL-8) or granulocyte colony-stimulating
              factor (G-CSF) potentiated the P-selectin-induced O2- production.
              Furthermore, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interferon-gamma
              (IFN-gamma) induced surface expression of P-selectin on platelets
              in the presence of a low concentration of thrombin and
              consequently enhanced their adhesion capacity to leukocytes.
              These results indicated that the adhesion of activated platelets
              to the leukocytes through the interaction between P-selectin and
              its carbohydrate ligand, sialyl Lewis X (LeX), was a crucial step
              for the activation of leukocyte function and supported the notion
              that activated platelets were actively involved in the
              inflammatory processes.",

              Escherichia coli L-asparaginase, and ten with Erwinia
              chrysanthemi L-asparaginase. L-asparaginase (ASP) treatment
              started halfway during ALL-induction treatment with vincristine,

              activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) level in all

              this same time interval, the mean fibrinogen level declined
              markedly from 3 g/l to 1.2 g/l (P < 0.001), probably due to
              prednisone therapy. The APTT stayed shortened during ASP therapy,
              whereas the hypofibrinogenemia recovered significantly faster in
              the Erwinia group (P < or = 0.01). Factors (F) II, V, VII and X
              stayed within the normal range, while F VIII and F IX were
              elevated. During the entire period of induction therapy, the
              ATIII activity remained within the normal range in both treatment
              groups. The protein C values, however, demonstrated a steady
              decline from 140\% at start of ASP treatment to a mean of 81\%
              and 93\%, respectively, at the end of the ASP therapy in the E.
              coli and Erwinia group. Five of the ten children treated with E.
              coli ASP demonstrated protein C levels below 70\% at the end of
              ASP therapy, opposed to none of the Erwinia treated patients (P =
              0.03). We suggest that the effect of ASP resulting in decreased
              coagulation factor synthesis is in part counterbalanced by the
              effect of prednisone on the coagulation system, when ASP is
              administered at the end of ALL induction treatment. The overall
              effect of ASP either of E. coli or of Erwinia on the hemorrhagic
              system reveals a slight imbalance towards thrombosis, mainly
              because of a gradual decrease in protein C activity. This
              imbalance is less pronounced in the Erwinia group.",

              (ITP) from other cause of thrombocytopenia remains a diagnosis of
              exclusion. Additionally factors that predict bleeding risk for
              those patients with ITP are currently not well understood.
              Previous small studies have suggested that immature platelet
              fraction (IPF) may differentiate ITP from other causes of
              thrombocytopenia and in combination with other factors may
              predict bleeding risk. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
              chart review of thrombocytopenic patients with an IPF measured
              between November 1, 2013 and July 1, 2015. Patients were between
              2 months and 21 years of age with a platelet count 5.2\%
              differentiated ITP from BMF with 93\% sensitivity and 91\%
              specificity. Absolute immature platelet number (AIPN) was
              significantly lower in ITP patients with severe to
              life-threatening hemorrhage than those without, despite similar
              platelet counts. On multivariate analysis, an IPF < 10.4\% was
              confirmed as an independent predictor of bleeding risk at
              platelet counts <10 $\times$ 109 /l in patients with ITP.
              CONCLUSIONS: IPF measurement alone has utility in both the
              diagnosis of ITP and identifying patients at increased risk of
              hemorrhage. Further study is required to understand the

              but the pathogenesis remains to be clarified. PROCEDURE: We
              conducted a multicenter, prospective study of 72 patients with
              ALL aged 1.0 to 15.2 years treated with either a
              Berlin-Frankfurt-M{\"u}nster (BFM) 95-ALL oriented regimen or

              the dynamic changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis using
              simultaneous thrombin and plasmin generation assay. Patients'
              plasma samples were collected at the prephase (T0), intermittent
              phase (T1), and postphase of L-Asp therapy (T2), and
              postinduction phase (T3). Measurements of endogenous thrombin
              potential (T-EP) and plasmin peak height (P-Peak) were compared
              to normal plasma. RESULTS: None of the cases developed
              thromboembolisms. Median ratios of T-EP and P-Peak for the
              controls in the JACLS group were 1.06 and 0.87 (T0), 1.04 and
              0.71 (T1), 1.02 and 0.69 (T2), and 1.20 and 0.92 (T3),

              P-Peak ratios in patients $\geq$10.0 years old were lower at T1

              myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited
              thrombocytopenia (IT) caused by mutations in the hematopoietic
              transcription factor RUNX1 and associated with an increased risk
              of developing myeloid neoplasms, such as AML and myelodysplastic
              syndromes (MDS). It is characterized by impaired megakaryopoiesis
              and moderate thrombocytopenia, with normal-sized and
              dysfunctional platelets. Aims: To unravel the molecular basis of
              ITs and to improve our knowledge on the molecular basis and
              clinical-laboratory picture of FPD/AML. Methods: Whole exome
              sequencing (WES) was performed in 86 propositi with an unknown IT
              after the diagnostic workup based on the must updated diagnostic
              algorithm for ITs (Clin Genet 2016;89:141). RUNX1 variants
              detected by WES were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the
              propositi and all available family members, which also undergo
              clinical and laboratory characterization. Results: We identified
              3 pedigrees with different RUNX1 heterozygous mutations: the
              novel variants c. 578T>A and c. 967+2-5del, and the known c.
              351+1G>A. The 13 affected subjects had mildly reduced platelet
              count, normal platelet size, variable expression of other
              morphological/functional platelet defects of alpha-granules
              content, glycoprotein expression and in vitro platelet
              aggregation. Three patients from 2 families developed AML, with a
              prevalence lower than reported in literature, probably because of
              a different criteria of enrolment (RUNX1 is usually analyzed in
              ITs associated with AML). Conclusions: FPD/AML lacks of
              pathognomonic criteria and is characterized by normal platelet
              size as the other ITs predisposing to hematological malignancies
              (ANKRD26 and ETV6-related thrombocytopenias). Given the
              importance of recognizing these diseases for patients'

              the platelets derived from them. Thus studies of the GPIIb gene
              may serve as a model of gene regulation during this process. Over
              the past several years, the genes for both GPIIb and IIIa have
              been cloned and analyzed. The GPIIb gene contains 30 exons over
              18 kilobases (kb). The transcriptional start site has been
              determined and there does not appear to be a TATA-box immediately
              upstream of this site. Studies have been done to define
              regulatory elements upstream of the transcriptional start site.
              Most of these studies focused on the human promoter and on
              studies using megakaryocytic cell lines. These studies have
              defined several important tissue-specific promoter elements
              including a GATA454 site (454 basepairs upstream of the
              transcriptional start site that involves a GATA-binding consensus
              sequence), a GATA54 site and an Ets35 site (that involves an
              Ets-binding consensus sequence). Expression studies with
              megakaryocytic cell lines suggest that each of these sites
              effects expression approximately threefold. Further, an Ets510
              site was also described that had a similar effect. While these
              studies were underway, we pursued studies of the rat 5'-flanking
              region using a rat primary marrow expression system.
              Qualitatively, our data support the human data; however,
              quantitatively, we found significant differences from the human
              studies done in cell lines. We found that the major
              tissue-specific promoter element was the GATA454 site. Mutations
              altering this site result in an approximately fiftyfold drop in
              expression. In comparison, eliminating the Ets510 site by
              truncation or point mutation had only a twofold effect on
              expression. Mutations at the Ets35 site did effect expression at
              a high level, decreasing expression approximately fifteenfold,
              while mutations at the GATA54 site effected expression by
              approximately ninefold. In addition, using 50 bp deletions, we
              have preliminarily defined two domains from -450 to -351 bp and
              -150 to -101 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site that
              effected expression. The former appears to contain a positive
              regulatory element, while the latter appears to be a silencer
              element.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

              thrombocytopenia (ITP), chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia
              (CIT), hepatitis C-related thrombocytopenia, and myelodysplastic
              syndromes (MDS). Until recently, the only treatments for
              thrombocytopenia were to alleviate the underlying cause or to
              provide platelet transfusions. With the discovery and recent
              clinical availability of thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics, a new
              treatment option has emerged. Two TPO mimetics are currently
              clinically available for treating ITP: romiplostim (an injectable
              peptide TPO mimetic) and eltrombopag (a non-peptide, orally
              available TPO mimetic). This chapter reviews the development,
              biology, and clinical trials with romiplostim. With few adverse
              effects, romiplostim is effective in raising the platelet count
              in over 80\% of ITP patients, allowing them to discontinue other
              therapies, reduce the need for splenectomy, and improve their
              quality of life. Long-term theoretical side effects of
              romiplostim treatment include reticulin formation,
              thromboembolism, and antibody formation to romiplostim. A
              practical way of using romiplostim is provided: a higher starting
              dose of 3 mg/kg is recommended along with efforts to avoid
              withholding the dose. Future studies will assess the utility of

              well as the possible mechanisms that produce sparsomycin
              toxicity. Tests on beagle dogs revealed that about 60\% of the

              eliminated by the kidneys. After a single bolus injection of 0.1
              mg/kg sparsomycin without narcosis, sparsomycin was eliminated

              excretion, thus resulting in a decrease in the drug's renal
              clearance and its accumulation in the plasma. Sparsomycin

              function and the synthesis of plasma proteins. Two out of five

              activity and deficiency of alpha-2 antiplasmin. Acquired
              disorders associated with increased fibrinolytic activity and
              bleeding include liver cirrhosis, amyloidosis, acute
              promyelocytic leukemia, some solid tumors, and certain snake
              envenomation syndromes. Increased fibrinolysis is important to
              recognize because epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) may be
              required to prevent or control bleeding. Diminished fibrinolytic
              activity has been associated with a variety of thrombotic
              disorders, but a direct cause-and-effect relationship has yet to
              be established. Congenital abnormalities of fibrinolysis
              associated with thrombosis include plasminogen deficiency,
              decreased endothelial generation of plasminogen activator
              activity, and certain abnormal fibrinogens. Thrombosis in these
              disorders is effectively managed with warfarin. Diminished
              fibrinolysis has also been reported in ``idiopathic'' venous
              thrombosis, oral contraceptive-induced and post-operative venous
              thrombosis, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease,
              systemic lupus erythematosus, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic
              purpura, but the significance of abnormal fibrinolysis in these
              disorders is uncertain. Large, prospective studies of
              fibrinolytic variables as risk factors for vascular and
              thrombotic disease are needed to determine whether pharmacologic
              augmentation of impaired fibrinolysis could be useful in the
              prevention or treatment of these disorders.",

              both in children and adults, and can be triggered by various
              inherited as well as acquired factors. Depending on the etiology,
              HLH can be divided into genetic (i.e., primary) and acquired
              (i.e., secondary) forms. Among genetic HLH forms, one can
              distinguish between familial HLH and other genetically
              conditioned forms of HLH. Acquired HLH can be typically triggered
              by infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. The most
              common symptoms of HLH are unremitting fever, splenomegaly, and
              peripheral blood cytopenia. Some severely ill patients present
              with central nervous system involvement. Laboratory tests reveal
              hyperferritinemia (often >10,000 $\mu$g/L), increased serum

              transaminases and bilirubin. Prognosis in HLH is very serious.

              administered. Similarly, severe acquired cases often lead to
              death without appropriate treatment. Since HLH can be encountered

              of inflammation. In the perfused rabbit ear 1 $\mu$g MGL
              inhibited the release of PGI2, PGD2 and PGE2 to the same extent
              as 1 $\mu$g indomethacin. The inhibition of COX-1 in the intact
              cell system was IC50 = 0.5 $\mu$M, that of indomethacin 0.0038
              $\mu$M. In the isolated enzyme preparations of COX-1 and COX-2
              the IC50 was 10 $\mu$M and 8 $\mu$M, that of indomethacin 9.2 mM
              and 2.4 $\mu$M. In the RBL-1 and PMNL test assay the inhibition
              of 5-LOX was 0.1 $\mu$M and 2.2 $\mu$M. An orally administered
              dose of 50 $\mu$g/kg/day induced no gastric ulcers in rats
              treated for 6 days. The investigations on carrageenan edema
              showed a close relationship between the structure of MGL and the
              anti-inflammatory effect. Conclusions. MGL is a COX-1, COX-2 and
              5-LOX inhibitor. In view of the moderate in vitro activity and
              the very potent in vivo activity an additive mechanism must be
              involved. Small changes in the molecular structure lead to the
              loss or reduction of the anti-inflammatory activity.",

              risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes are
              unclear. Fibrin clot structure has been related to CVD risk in
              the general population. We therefore assessed this in type 2
              diabetic patients as a potential mechanism whereby diabetes
              influences CVD risk. METHODS: Fibrin clots were formed from
              fibrinogen purified from 150 subjects with type 2 diabetes and
              varying degrees of glycaemic control (assessed by HbA1c), and
              from 50 matched control subjects. Clot structure was assessed by
              turbidity, permeation and confocal microscopy. The specific
              effect of glucose itself was assessed by analysing the structure
              of clots formed from purified fibrinogen in the presence of
              increasing concentrations of the sugar. RESULTS: Clots formed by
              fibrinogen purified from type 2 diabetic subjects had a denser,
              less porous structure than those from control subjects. The
              structural changes found were related to the individual's
              glycaemic control; HbA1c correlated negatively with permeation
              coefficient (Ks) values (indicates clot pore size) (r = -0.57, p
              or = 10 mmol/l) were both associated with a reduction in Ks
              values and maximum absorbance, and with increased fibre density
              and branch point number within clots. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:
              The structural differences found to occur in type 2 diabetes and
              in association with hypo- and hyperglycaemia may confer increased
              resistance to fibrinolysis, and in consequence contribute to the
              increase in CVD risk in diabetic patients.",

  abstract = "Question The Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4) is a
              versatile efflux transporter, known to transport second messenger
              molecules, in particular cyclic nucleotides and certain lipid
              mediators. Based on this transport, MRP4 plays a role for several
              physiological processes especially for platelet function.
              Therefore, a deeper understanding of the regulation of the
              protein is required. The aim of this study was to identify
              transcription factors important for the basal expression of MRP4.
              Methods The 5'-proximal promoter region of the MRP4/ABCC4 gene
              was cloned in a luciferase reporter vector and a series of
              5'-deletion constructs was generated. The constructs were
              transfected in a number of different cell lines, especially HeLa
              cells and the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line M07e as a model
              for megakaryocytes. Mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and
              site-directed mutagenesis of putative binding sites were
              performed to identify essential transcription factors. Results In
              all studied cell lines (HEK-293, CaCo-2, HeLa, M07e) a marked
              increase in the reporter signal was observed between the-34/+119
              und-69/+119 promoter constructs, suggesting that-69/+119 is the
              minimal region required for basal transcription of MRP4. By means
              of EMSAs, binding of Sp1 and Ets transcription factors to this
              region could be demonstrated. Analysis of the evolutionary
              conservation also indicated that the binding sites of these
              factors are highly conserved. For both factors, site-directed
              mutagenesis of the putative binding elements led to a marked
              decrease in the promoter activity confirming their importance for
              basal expression of MRP4. The mutational analysis also suggested
              an involvement of these factors in the transcriptional
              up-regulation of MRP4 by cAMP. Conclusion Based on its
              physiological role in platelets, MRP4 has emerged as a potential
              pharmacologic target in atherothrombotic diseases. However, so
              far little is known about its transcriptional regulation. The
              results of the present study suggest that Sp1 and Ets
              transcription factors are key regulators of the basal MRP4

              plasma VWF, multimer analysis indicated association of the IgM
              paraprotein with VWF before, but not after plasmapheresis,
              resulting in destruction of the agarose gel and a
              characteristically distorted band structure of VWF multimers. A
              type-2 pattern with highly abnormal VWF triplets and laboratory
              evidence of excessive fibrinolytic activity suggested that
              plasmin-mediated VWF degradation contributed to AVWS in a patient
              with multiple myeloma (MM) and AL amyloidosis. Finally, in a
              patient with IgG MM, maximally prolonged PFA-100\textregistered{}

              platelet agglutination, both of which resolved after remission

              binding to platelet GPIb. Importantly, in none of the six
              patients, circulating autoantibodies to VWF were detected by a
              specific in-house ELISA. In summary, when evaluating PCD patients

              staining was practically negative; in another 5 AML-M7 cases,
              anti-LAT labeling was much stronger than anti-VWF staining. LAT
              represents a useful immunohistochemical marker for megakaryocytes

              megakaryocytes, such as acute megakaryocytic leukemias. The use

              transcripts and translational expressions of both ANXA2 and

  abstract = "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a unique subtype of acute
              myeloid leukemia that is characterized by distinct clinical,
              morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular abnormalities. It is
              associated with a striking risk of early hemorrhagic death due to
              disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperfibrinolysis. The
              prognosis of APL has improved dramatically following the
              introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its
              combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy during
              induction and consolidation. Patients with high-risk APL, defined
              by a white cell count >10 $\times$ 10(9)/L at diagnosis, also
              appear to benefit from the addition of intermediate- or high-dose
              cytarabine during consolidation. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has
              proved to be even more effective than ATRA as a single agent, and
              is now routinely used for the treatment of the 20\%-30\% of
              patients who manifest disease relapse after initial treatment
              with ATRA and chemotherapy. ATO has a toxicity profile that
              differs considerably from that of both ATRA and cytotoxic
              chemotherapy, and accordingly presents its own specific
              challenges during treatment. Optimizing a strategy for the
              incorporation of ATO into initial therapy is currently the focus
              of several cooperative group trials, with an emphasis on
              minimizing or even eradicating the use of chemotherapy. ATRA plus
              ATO without chemotherapy appears to be adequate during induction
              and consolidation for patients with standard-risk APL, but triple
              therapy that includes limited anthracycline or gemtuzumab
              ozogamicin (GO) during induction is required for high-risk APL.
              Uncertainty still exists regarding the minimum amount of
              chemotherapy and number of consolidation cycles necessary, the
              optimal scheduling of ATO, and the potential utility of oral ATO
              administration. Although prolonged oral maintenance therapy is
              usually included in most current APL treatment protocols, its
              value remains controversial, and the superior anti-leukemic
              efficacy of ATO-based therapy may facilitate its elimination in
              the future.",

              appropriate therapeutic options. However, the mechanisms
              ultimately responsible for the increased thrombotic tendency have

              MPL have been described in MPNs and serve as disease markers.
              There is also evidence that a JAK2V617F mutant state represents

              patients. METHODS: A total of 65 newly diagnosed ALL patients
              upto 18 y of age along with 30 age and sex matched controls were
              included in the study. Coagulation tests including Prothrombin

              inhibitor levels and tests for fibrinolysis were performed.
              RESULTS: At baseline, APTT of the patients was significantly
              prolonged (p 0.033), but PT and fibrinogen were comparable in the
              two groups. Protein C (PC) and Protein S (PS) were both

              remain refractory to this approach. Patients may require frequent

              inconvenient. Life-threatening bleeding complications still occur
              despite prophylactic platelet transfusion. Thrombopoietin (TPO)
              mimetics, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag, were developed to

              elevating high ploidy cell formation in the MK-differentiated
              CHRF-288-11 (CHRF) cells. Our result showed that BMS-777607
              strongly inhibited cell division without affecting cell viability
              when detected at day 1 after treatment. As a consequence, the
              high ploidy ($\geq$8N) cells were accumulated in culture for 8
              days, with an increase from 16.2 to 75.2 \% of the total cell
              population. The elevated polyploidization was accompanied by the
              increased expression level of MK marker, CD41 (platelet

  abstract = "Drugs may play an important role in development of thrombosis,
              and in recent years there has been increased attention to the
              importance of this issue. Although drug-induced thrombosis
              usually causes venous thrombotic events, arterial events are also
              noted due to drug administration. Here we review the different
              mechanisms through which drugs can exert thrombosis. Drugs can
              cause direct endothelial damage and expose the underlying
              subendothelium thus leading to platelet adherence and subsequent
              thrombus formation. Such an effect is seen by contrast media and
              chemotherapeutic cytotoxic drugs. Drugs may also attenuate the
              secretion of pro- and anticoagulation mediators by the
              endothelial cells and may have prothrombotic effects on platelets
              by increasing adhesion and aggregation, as for example seen after
              heparin administration in an immune-mediated mechanism. Red and
              white cells can also be affected by drugs, by increasing their
              aggregation or adhesion to the endothelial wall. Some drugs, such
              as oral contraceptive pills, may promote thrombosis by altering
              the balance between the different coagulation factors, and many
              drugs can lead to decreased blood flow by increasing blood
              viscosity, as seen for example after intravenous immunoglobulin
              administration. Better understanding of the mechanisms through
              which drugs exert thrombosis may facilitate their safe use in
              patients. Additionally, awareness of the drugs that are known to
              induce thrombosis is important in order to stop their
              administration in case of a thrombotic event. This review further
              emphasizes the fact that drug administration is a risk factor
              that should always be considered together with additional known
              thromboembolic risk factors such as genetic predisposition or
              cancer. \copyright{} 2013 Springer International Publishing

  author   = "Burns, T R and Saleem, A",
  abstract = "Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura occurs at all ages, in acute
              and chronic forms. Children mainly have the acute form, which
              usually follows a recent viral illness, occurs equally in both
              sexes, and generally resolves within six months. Chronic
              idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura occurs more often in adults,
              often has an insidious onset, and shows a three:one female
              preponderance. Both forms are now thought to be due to an
              antiplatelet antibody, usually of the IgG class
              (platelet-associated IgG), which coats autologous platelets and
              leads to their phagocytosis and destruction by the
              reticuloendothelial system. In most patients, the spleen is the
              major site of the production of this platelet antibody and the
              destruction of the platelets. Many methods have been developed to
              detect this antiplatelet factor in the serum and on the platelets
              of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Recent
              methods are becoming highly sensitive and may soon be simple and
              fast enough for routine clinical use and should significantly aid
              the diagnosis and management of these patients.
              Platelet-associated IgG levels appear significantly higher in
              patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura than in normal
              subjects, and in patients with nonimmune thrombocytopenia. Higher
              levels are also seen in children than in adults, and in acute
              cases than in chronic ones. Platelet-associated IgG levels also
              vary inversely with platelet count and platelet life span, can
              predict the disease course and response to therapy, and may
              predict neonatal consequences of maternal idiopathic
              thrombocytopenic purpura. Evidence of other alterations in immune
              status, as well as alterations in platelet function and HLA
              associations, remains controversial. Classic treatment with
              corticosteroids and splenectomy remains highly successful in most
              cases. More recent therapies include the use of
              immunosuppressants and alkaloid-coated platelets, plasma-exchange
              transfusion, and high-dose immunoglobulin. Overall, fewer than 5

              compact and even occasionally spheroidal, typical images were
              elongated symmetrical tridomainal structures 460 {\AA} $\pm$ 20
              {\AA} in length; frequently they were bent into a variety of

              monomolecular forms of fibrinogen by scanning transmission
              electron microscopic mass measurements resolved uncertainties
              relating to the identity of such objects as single molecules. The
              central domains of fraction I-4 molecules had a greater mass than
              those of fraction I-9 (1.01 $\times$ 105Mrversus 7.5 $\times$ 10
              Mr, respectively). This difference accounted for the observed
              mass difference between fraction I-4 and fraction I-9 molecules
              (i.e. 3.27 $\times$ 105Mrversus 2.97 $\times$ 105Mr,

              A$\alpha$ chain (major portions of which are always absent from
              fraction I-9 molecules) is situated within the mass integration

              a thread-like structure originating between the middle and outer
              domains and extending toward the central domain, sometimes
              appearing to wind around the long axis. The outer domains of
              negatively stained molecules resembled negatively stained images
              of fragment D1 and could frequently be resolved into at least two
              discrete subdomains, forming an oblong structure usually canted
              at an angle of ∼120 ° to 150 ° relative to the long axis. Our

              null cell ALL were associated with hypofibrinogenemia not adapted
              for DIC. The sample used was the lysate of 10(7) cells. PCA was
              measured by recalcification time of normal plasma with the cell
              lysate, XAA and PlgAA was measured by chromogenic substrate. APL
              and AML, especially those associated with overt DIC, had high
              PCA, and lymphocytic leukemia generally had low PCA in comparison
              with normal controls. Total PCA (PCA multiplied by cell
              count/microliter) was remarkably increased in DIC and mildly
              increased in ALL with hypofibrinogenemia. The change in XAA and

              We measured fibrinopeptide A (FPA) changes in 14 patients with

              Homologous- and cross-desensitization studies using sequential
              addition of nucleotides showed that the ADP-induced calcium
              response in HEL cells was mediated mainly by purinoceptor(s) for
              which ADP but not ATP was an agonist. There were also minor
              contributions from purinoceptors for which ATP and ADP are both
              agonists (probably P2U and P2Y). ATP inhibited the ADP-induced
              calcium response in HEL cells. This inhibition was overcome by
              raising the ADP concentration, thus indicating that ATP was an
              antagonist for the HEL cell ADP receptor. AMP was also an
              antagonist, albeit weak, for the HEL cell ADP receptor.
              Antagonism of the ADP-induced calcium response by ATP was
              similarly observed in MEG-01 cells, another human
              megakaryocyte-like cell line, but not in 293 cells, a

              express an ADP receptor for which ATP and AMP are antagonists.
              This characteristic of the HEL cell ADP receptor is also
              displayed by the platelet P2T receptor. Thus, HEL cells appear to

              efficiency depends on the rate of formation of hemostatic plugs
              as well as the structural integrity and stability of the formed
              hemostatic plugs. Fibrin elements are major constituents
              contributing to the structural integrity and stability, but they
              are subject to fibrinolytic activity occurring spontaneously
              after fibrin formation. Fibrinolysis is usually suppressed by
              endogenous inhibitors. Increase of a profibrinolytic component or
              deficiency of an inhibitor would result in an accelerated
              fibrinolysis, causing a premature lysis of hemostatic plugs
              before restoration of injured vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic
              tendency. Such a state can be seen typically in patients with
              congenital deficiency of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor or a
              hereditary increase of plasminogen activator, and it is also seen

              promyelocytic leukaemia. Although procoagulant substances
              released from leukaemic blast cells may induce DIC by activating
              conventional coagulation pathways, there is increasing evidence
              to suggest that direct activation of fibrinogen by proteases
              released from blast cells may be the predominant mechanism by
              which DIC is initiated. Primary fibrinolysis has also been
              proposed as the cause of the haemorrhagic diathesis in some cases
              of acute leukaemia. Although plasminogen activators have been
              demonstrated in leukaemic blast cells supporting this view, cases
              of primary fibrinolysis would appear to be rare. A bleeding
              tendency attributed to primary fibrinolysis may more often be the
              result of an exaggerated fibrinolytic response secondary to DIC.
              The main strategies of treatment for leukaemia associated DIC are
              rapid initiation of chemotherapy and vigorous blood product
              support until the DIC resolves once the blast cells have been

  author   = "Board, P G and Losowsky, M S and Miloszewski, K J",
  abstract = "Factor XIII (XIII), an enzyme found in plasma (present as a
              pro-enzyme), platelets and monocytes, is essential for normal
              haemostasis. It may also have a role to play in the processes of
              wound healing and tissue repair. Inherited XIII deficiency
              results in a life-long, severe bleeding diathesis which, if
              untreated, carries a very high risk of death in early life from
              intracranial bleeding. XIII is a zymogen requiring thrombin and
              calcium for activation. In plasma, XIII has two subunits: the 'a'
              subunit, which is the active enzyme, and the 'b' subunit which is
              a carrier protein. Activated XIII modifies the structure of clot
              by covalently crosslinking fibrin through an epsilon
              (gamma-glutamyl)lysine link. It also crosslinks other proteins,
              including fibronectin and alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha-2PI),
              into the clot through the same link. Clot modified by XIII is
              physically stronger, relatively more resistant to fibrinolysis
              and may be a more suitable medium for the ingrowth of
              fibroblasts. Inheritance of factor XIII is autosomal recessive.
              The majority of patients with the inherited defect show no XIII
              activity and absence of 'a' subunit protein in plasma, platelets
              and monocytes. At the molecular level, the defect is not a major
              gene rearrangement or deletion, but most likely a single point
              mutation which may be different in each family. Because of the
              severity of the bleeding diathesis, prophylaxis is desirable and
              has been shown to be very effective as the in vivo half-life of
              plasma XIII is long, and low plasma levels are sufficient for
              haemostasis. Acquired inhibitors have been reported in only two
              cases with inherited XIII deficiency. Acquired XIII deficiency
              has been described in a variety of diseases and bleeding has been
              controlled by therapy with large doses of XIII in such conditions
              as Henoch-Sch{\"o}nlein purpura, various forms of colitis,
              erosive gastritis and some forms of leukaemia. Large dose XIII
              therapy has also been used in an endeavour to promote wound
              healing after surgery and bone union in non-healing fractures.
              The use of XIII in these conditions remains controversial. Very
              rarely a bleeding diathesis results from the development of a
              specific inhibitor to XIII arising de novo, often as a
              complication in the course of a disease or in association with
              long-term drug therapy. The bleeding diathesis in these patients

              life-threatening bleeding. All-trans retinoic acid has greatly

              coagulation. Clinically, disseminated intravascular coagulation
              (DIC) in cancer has in general a less fulminant presentation than
              the types of DIC complicating sepsis and trauma. A more gradual,
              but also more chronic, systemic activation of coagulation can
              proceed subclinically. The relationship between venous
              thromboembolism and cancer as a consequence of the
              hypercoagulability will be discussed as well. Furthermore, the
              role of perturbed endothelium in the pathogenesis of
              microvascular dysfunction and microangiopathy in particular in
              the setting of cancer and chemo- or radiotherapy will be

  abstract = "Background: Microparticles (MPs) are membrane vesicles shed from
              various cells. MPs may express antigens reflecting their cellular
              origin. Tissue factor (TF)-bearing MPs play a major role in the
              pathogenesis of the prothtombotic state observed in patients with
              malignancies. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
              characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells, can
              develop venous thromboembolism despite thrombocytopenia. We
              hypothesize that circulating MPs may serve as a biomarker
              indicating changes in blood cell populations and potentially
              predicting thrombogenic states in AML patients at diagnosis and
              remission. Methods: Blood samples were collected from healthy
              controls and patients with newly diagnosed AML at three time
              points: diagnosis, nadir and remission achievement. MP cell
              origins were characterized by specific fluorescent antibodies and
              analyzed by FACS. MPs were labelled for various antigens,
              including CD34, CD33-blast leukemic cell markers. To determine
              the procoagulant and anti-coagulant potential each sample was
              labelled with florescent antibodies against TF and tissue factor
              pathway inhibitor (TFPI). MP procoagulant activity was also
              evaluated using FXa chromogenic assay. Results: Forty two AML
              patients were enrolled in the study. The level of the platelet
              marker was significantly higher in controls compared to AML
              patients at diagnosis (30.7\% vs. 10.3\%; p < 0.05), while the
              value of activated platelet marker was similar in both groups.
              The MP-CD34 level was significantly higher in patients at
              diagnosis comparing to controls (4.4\% vs. 1.4\%; p < 0.001) and
              to MPs of patients at remission (4.4\% vs. 1.7\%; p < 0.05). The
              MP-CD33 rate was also found to be significantly increased in
              patients at diagnosis compared to controls and patients in
              remission (34.9\% vs. 15.3\%; p < 0.05; and 15.7\%; p < 0.01,
              respectively). MP procoagulant activity was significantly
              elevated in patients at diagnosis and remission compared to
              controls (100.5 AU vs. 58.5 AU; p < 0.05, and 135 AU vs. 58.5 AU;
              p < 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: MPs of AML patients at
              diagnosis express blast cell antigens and could potentially serve
              as a biomarker of disease and remission. Increase in endothelial
              MPs at AML diagnosis suggests a vascular injury that can be
              detected by TF/TFPI ratio on MPs.",

              occurrence of venous thrombosis in multiple myeloma is not only

              fibrinolysis. Studies showed a prevalence of up to 25\% in

              is a systemic process characterized by excessive coagulation

              The underlying pathomechanisms are still poorly understood.
              Recent experimental studies found an important role for the
              interaction between procoagulant neutrophil extracellular traps

              AIM: To investigate whether NETs and TF-bearing microvesicles

              AND METHODS: Twenty-eight cancer patients with overt DIC (ISTH

              13 with solid tumors, 15 with acute leukemia) and 28 matched
              healthy controls were included. NET formation parameters (plasma
              DNA and nucleosomes), MVassociated TF activity, and routine
              coagulation parameters were determined at study inclusion. In 11
              patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), follow-up
              measurements were also performed. RESULTS: Plasma DNA,
              nucleosomes, and MV-TF activity were highly elevated in patients
              with cancer-related DIC compared to healthy individuals (all
              p-values<0.001). Strong correlations were found between plasma
              DNA and nucleosomes (Spearman correlation-coefficient: r=0.68),
              nucleosomes and MV-TF activity (r=0.62), and DNA and MV-TF
              activity (r=0.57). In multivariate regression, altered routine
              coagulation parameters were highly associated with NET parameters
              and MV-TF activity. In detail, a doubling in plasma DNA was
              associated with a 7.6\% decrease in fibrinogen (p=0.012), a
              15.3\% decrease in platelet count (p=0.002), a 3.9\% decrease in
              prothrombin time (p=0.014), and a 41.0\% increase in D-dimer
              (p<0.001). A 10\% increase in nucleosomes was associated with a
              3.1\% decrease in fibrinogen (p<0.001), a 5.0\% decrease in
              platelet count (p<0.001), a 1.0\% decrease in prothrombin time
              (p<0.009), and a 112.7\% increase in D-dimer (p<0.001). A 10\%
              increase in MV-TF activity was associated with a 4.9\% decrease
              in fibrinogen (p<0.001), a 7.1\% decrease in platelet count
              (p<0.001), a 1.3\% decrease in prothrombin time (p<0.001), and a
              15.5\% increase in D-dimer (p<0.001). After initiation of
              chemotherapy in AML patients, NET parameters and MV-TF activity
              decreased significantly (nucleosomes: 3.3-fold decrease and
              normalization after 1 week; DNA: 1.2-fold decrease after 1 week
              and 1.5-fold decrease after 1 month; MV-TF activity: 10-fold
              decease after 1 week and normalization after 1 month) (Figure 1),
              and routine coagulation parameters improved. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results add to experimental studies that have investigated the
              interaction between NETs and TF. Taken together, evidence
              indicates the presence of a liaison dangereuse between NETs and

@ARTICLE{Weisel2005-cg,
  title    = "Fibrinogen and fibrin",
  author   = "Weisel, John W",
  abstract = "Fibrinogen is a large, complex, fibrous glycoprotein with three
              pairs of polypeptide chains linked together by 29 disulfide
              bonds. It is 45 nm in length, with globular domains at each end
              and in the middle connected by alpha-helical coiled-coil rods.
              Both strongly and weakly bound calcium ions are important for
              maintenance of fibrinogen's structure and functions. The
              fibrinopeptides, which are in the central region, are cleaved by
              thrombin to convert soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin
              polymer, via intermolecular interactions of the ``knobs'' exposed
              by fibrinopeptide removal with ``holes'' always exposed at the
              ends of the molecules. Fibrin monomers polymerize via these
              specific and tightly controlled binding interactions to make
              half-staggered oligomers that lengthen into protofibrils. The
              protofibrils aggregate laterally to make fibers, which then
              branch to yield a three-dimensional network-the fibrin
              clot-essential for hemostasis. X-ray crystallographic structures
              of portions of fibrinogen have provided some details on how these
              interactions occur. Finally, the transglutaminase, Factor XIIIa,
              covalently binds specific glutamine residues in one fibrin
              molecule to lysine residues in another via isopeptide bonds,
              stabilizing the clot against mechanical, chemical, and
              proteolytic insults. The gene regulation of fibrinogen synthesis
              and its assembly into multichain complexes proceed via a series
              of well-defined steps. Alternate splicing of two of the chains
              yields common variant molecular isoforms. The mechanical
              properties of clots, which can be quite variable, are essential
              to fibrin's functions in hemostasis and wound healing. The
              fibrinolytic system, with the zymogen plasminogen binding to
              fibrin together with tissue-type plasminogen activator to promote
              activation to the active enzyme plasmin, results in digestion of
              fibrin at specific lysine residues. Fibrin(ogen) also
              specifically binds a variety of other proteins, including
              fibronectin, albumin, thrombospondin, von Willebrand factor,
              fibulin, fibroblast growth factor-2, vascular endothelial growth
              factor, and interleukin-1. Studies of naturally occurring
              dysfibrinogenemias and variant molecules have increased our
              understanding of fibrinogen's functions. Fibrinogen binds to
              activated alphaIIbbeta3 integrin on the platelet surface, forming
              bridges responsible for platelet aggregation in hemostasis, and
              also has important adhesive and inflammatory functions through
              specific interactions with other cells. Fibrinogen-like domains
              originated early in evolution, and it is likely that their
              specific and tightly controlled intermolecular interactions are
              involved in other aspects of cellular function and developmental

               transfusion on the number of transfusions and safety in patients
               with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. METHODS: We did a
               multicentre, open-label, randomised parallel-group trial at
               eight haematology centres in Germany. Patients aged 16-80 years,
               who were undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid
               leukaemia or autologous haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation
               for haematological cancers, were randomly assigned via a
               computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive either
               platelet transfusion when bleeding occurred (therapeutic
               strategy) or when morning platelet counts were 10$\times$10(9)
               per L or lower (prophylactic strategy). Investigators
               undertaking interventions were not masked to group assignment.
               The primary endpoint was the number of platelet transfusions.
               Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered,
               NCT00521664. FINDINGS: 197 patients were assigned the
               prophylactic strategy and 199 the therapeutic strategy. Of 391
               patients analysed, the therapeutic strategy reduced the mean
               number of platelet transfusions by 33·5\% (95\% CI 22·2-43·1;
               p<0·0001) in all patients (2·44 [2·22-2·67] in prophylactic
               group vs 1·63 [1·42-1·83] in therapeutic group), 31·6\%
               (18·6-42·6; p<0·0001) in those with acute myeloid leukaemia
               (2·68 [2·35-3·01] vs 1·83 [1·58-2·10]), and 34·2\% (6·6-53·7;
               p=0·0193) in those who had had autologous transplantation (1·80
               [1·45-2·15] vs 1·18 [0·82-1·55]. We noted no increased risk of
               major haemorrhage in patients who had undergone autologous
               transplantation. In those with acute myeloid leukaemia, risk of
               non-fatal grade 4 (mostly CNS) bleeding was increased. We
               recorded 15 cases of non-fatal haemorrhage: four retinal in each
               transfusion group, and one vaginal and six cerebral in the
               therapeutic group. 12 patients died in the study: two from fatal
               cerebral haemorrhages in the therapeutic group, and ten (five in
               each treatment group) unrelated to major bleeding.
               INTERPRETATION: The therapeutic strategy could become a new
               standard of care after autologous stem-cell transplantation;
               however, prophylactic platelet transfusion should remain the
               standard for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. The new
               strategy should be used by some haematology centres only if the
               staff are well educated and experienced in the new approach and
               can react in a timely way to first signs of CNS bleeding.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading cause of
              maternal death worldwide. Early administration of tranexamic acid
              reduces deaths due to bleeding in trauma patients. We aimed to
              assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on
              death, hysterectomy, and other relevant outcomes in women with
              post-partum haemorrhage. METHODS: In this randomised,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women aged
              16 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of post-partum
              haemorrhage after a vaginal birth or caesarean section from 193
              hospitals in 21 countries. We randomly assigned women to receive
              either 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo in
              addition to usual care. If bleeding continued after 30 min, or
              stopped and restarted within 24 h of the first dose, a second
              dose of 1 g of tranexamic acid or placebo could be given.
              Patients were assigned by selection of a numbered treatment pack
              from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical
              apart from the pack number. Participants, care givers, and those
              assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. We originally
              planned to enrol 15 000 women with a composite primary endpoint
              of death from all-causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of giving
              birth. However, during the trial it became apparent that the
              decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same
              time as randomisation. Although tranexamic acid could influence
              the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of
              hysterectomy. We therefore increased the sample size from 15 000
              to 20 000 women in order to estimate the effect of tranexamic
              acid on the risk of death from post-partum haemorrhage. All
              analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is
              registered with ISRCTN76912190 (Dec 8, 2008); ClinicalTrials.gov,
              number NCT00872469; and PACTR201007000192283. FINDINGS: Between
              March, 2010, and April, 2016, 20 060 women were enrolled and
              randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (n=10 051) or
              placebo (n=10 009), of whom 10 036 and 9985, respectively, were
              included in the analysis. Death due to bleeding was significantly
              reduced in women given tranexamic acid (155 [1·5\%] of 10 036
              patients vs 191 [1·9\%] of 9985 in the placebo group, risk ratio
              [RR] 0·81, 95\% CI 0·65-1·00; p=0·045), especially in women given
              treatment within 3 h of giving birth (89 [1·2\%] in the
              tranexamic acid group vs 127 [1·7\%] in the placebo group, RR
              0·69, 95\% CI 0·52-0·91; p=0·008). All other causes of death did
              not differ significantly by group. Hysterectomy was not reduced
              with tranexamic acid (358 [3·6\%] patients in the tranexamic acid
              group vs 351 [3·5\%] in the placebo group, RR 1·02, 95\% CI
              0·88-1·07; p=0·84). The composite primary endpoint of death from
              all causes or hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid
              (534 [5·3\%] deaths or hysterectomies in the tranexamic acid
              group vs 546 [5·5\%] in the placebo group, RR 0·97, 95\% CI
              0·87-1·09; p=0·65). Adverse events (including thromboembolic
              events) did not differ significantly in the tranexamic acid
              versus placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid reduces
              death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage with
              no adverse effects. When used as a treatment for postpartum
              haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible
              after bleeding onset. FUNDING: London School of Hygiene \&

              $\times$ 106/kg were associated with faster platelet engraftment.
              We compared engraftment rates in patients receiving CD34+ doses

              We also studied neutrophil engraftment rates and platelet and red
              blood cell transfusion requirements. In multivariate adjusted
              models, the rate of platelet recovery to $\geq$20,000/$\mu$L was
              4-fold greater among subjects who received HD-ASCT (hazard ratio

              platelet transfusions among the subjects who received HD-ASCT
              (mean transfusions, 3.7 versus 9.8; P = .005). Although not

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Preclinical data and results from non-randomised
              trials suggest that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib might be
              an effective drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.
              We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib versus
              placebo in addition to standard chemotherapy in patients with
              acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger. METHODS: This
              randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was
              done at 25 sites in Germany. We enrolled patients aged 18-60
              years with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myeloid
              leukaemia who had a WHO clinical performance score 0-2, adequate
              renal and liver function, no cardiac comorbidities, and no recent
              trauma or operation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to
              receive two cycles of induction therapy with daunorubicin (60
              mg/m(2) on days 3-5) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) on days 1-7),
              followed by three cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation
              therapy (3 g/m(2) twice daily on days 1, 3, and 5) plus either
              sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo on days 10-19 of
              induction cycles 1 and 2, from day 8 of each consolidation, and
              as maintenance for 12 months. Allogeneic stem-cell
              transplantation was scheduled for all intermediate-risk patients
              with a sibling donor and for all high-risk patients with a
              matched donor in first remission. Computer-generated
              randomisation was done in blocks. The primary endpoint was
              event-free survival, with an event defined as either primary
              treatment failure or relapse or death, assessed in all randomised
              patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. We
              report the final analysis. This trial is registered with
              ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00893373, and the EU Clinical
              Trials Register (2008-004968-40). FINDINGS: Between March 27,
              2009, and Nov 28, 2011, 276 patients were enrolled and
              randomised, of whom nine did not receive study medication. 267
              patients were included in the primary analysis (placebo, n=133;
              sorafenib, n=134). With a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR
              35·5-38·1), median event-free survival was 9 months (95\% CI
              4-15) in the placebo group versus 21 months (9-32) in the
              sorafenib group, corresponding to a 3-year event-free survival of
              22\% (95\% CI 13-32) in the placebo group versus 40\% (29-51) in
              the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·64, 95\% CI; 0·45-0·91;
              p=0·013). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups
              were fever (71 [53\%] in the placebo group vs 73 [54\%] in the
              sorafenib group), infections (55 [41\%] vs 46 [34\%]), pneumonia
              (21 [16\%] vs 20 [14\%]), and pain (13 [10\%] vs 15 [11\%]).
              Grade 3 or worse adverse events that were significantly more
              common in the sorafenib group than the placebo group were fever
              (relative risk [RR] 1·54, 95\% CI 1·04-2·28), diarrhoea (RR 7·89,
              2·94-25·2), bleeding (RR 3·75, 1·5-10·0), cardiac events (RR
              3·46, 1·15-11·8), hand-foot-skin reaction (only in sorafenib
              group), and rash (RR 4·06, 1·25-15·7). INTERPRETATION: In
              patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger,
              the addition of sorafenib to standard chemotherapy has
              antileukaemic efficacy but also increased toxicity. Our findings
              suggest that kinase inhibitors could be a useful addition to
              curative treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia. Overall survival
              after long-term follow-up and strategies to reduce toxicity are
              needed to determine the future role of sorafenib in treatment of
              this disease. FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare.",

  abstract = "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a cause of death in
              hematologic malignancies. Asparaginase represents a key agent in
              the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The toxicity
              of asparaginase includes coagulopathy such as thrombotic or
              bleeding tendency. We report a case of fatal cerebral hemorrhage
              in a 12-year-old girl treated for ALL. Cerebral hemorrhage
              occurred after three injections of L-asparaginase. The patient
              presented with hypofibrinogenemia (0.36g/L), associated with
              thrombocytopenia (24,000/mm3). Despite maximal medical and
              surgical treatment (platelets and fresh-frozen plasma
              transfusions, red blood cells transfusion, fibrinogen replacement
              therapy, and craniotomy discharge), the patient died.
              L-asparaginase is well known for its prothrombotic action. By
              inhibiting the synthesis of fibrinogen and factors V, VII, VIII,
              and IX, it causes an increased risk of bleeding, including
              intracranial bleeding. Predictive scores for ICH onset have been
              established but there is no consensus on the management of
              coagulation disorders induced by L-asparaginase. It is
              recommended to check fibrinogen and antithrombin (AT) blood
              values in order to substitute them if they drop to < 1 g/L for
              fibrinogen and < 60\% for AT. The management of
              asparaginase-induced ICH does not differ from that of ICH of
              other origin. The risk of death is high, and surgical treatment
              has not proven superior to medical therapy in terms of mortality
              rates and 6-month survival. Further studies are needed to define
              consensus guidelines for coagulation disorders induced by
              asparaginase and also to define the specific management in cases
              of ICH in childhood hematological malignancies.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Fibrinogen is an acute phase glycoprotein whose
              concentration increases in response to trauma. The newly
              synthesised protein is functionally enhanced and it is known that
              treatment with neuraminidase increases the rate of fibrin
              polymerisation. To explore this, we examined the differences
              between the oligosaccharide structures of quiescent and acute
              phase fibrinogen. METHODS: A series of plasma samples was
              obtained from two individuals suffering an acute phase response.
              Fibrinogen chains were examined directly by ESI mass spectrometry
              before and after digestion with N-glycosidase F and $\beta$1,4
              galactosidase. RESULTS: The B$\beta$ and $\gamma$ chains of acute
              phase fibrinogen showed a mass decrease of 162 Da (Gal) in some
              50\% of the molecules, and the B$\beta$ chain showed an
              additional decrease corresponding to a further loss of NAcGlc.
              Incubation with N-glycosidase F normalised all isoform masses to
              that of the quiescent naked protein, confirming the N-linked
              oligosaccharide as the source of heterogeneity. $\beta$1,4
              galactosidase treatment showed the structural difference was the
              absence of the penultimate Gal from the biantennary
              oligosaccharides, and mapping of tryptic glycopeptides confirmed
              these results showing that approximately half the chains lacked
              Gal. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The failure of incorporation
              Gal excludes the possibility of the hepatic NAcNeu Gal
              transferase capping the oligosaccharides with sialic acid. This
              has two desirable haemostatic outcomes: fibrin monomers will
              polymerise and form clots more rapidly, and two galactose
              residues can never be exposed diminishing uptake of the protein
              by the asialoglycoprotein receptor and ramping up concentration
              at a time of challenge.",

              Historically, this uncommon subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia
              has been associated with a high mortality rate during induction
              therapy, most frequently attributable to haemorrhage. Since the
              introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) into the therapy

              survival have improved dramatically, such that the disease is now

              problem and haemorrhage still accounts for the majority of such

              and/or host cells, and the direct adhesion of tumour cells to

              cytometric immunobead array (FCIA) assay to detect platelet
              autoantibodies commonly present in bleeding patients with immune
              thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). METHODS: Polystyrene microbeads
              coated with antibodies against human platelet glycoproteins (GPs)
              IX (SZ1), Ib (SZ2), IIIa (SZ21), IIb (SZ22), and P-selectin
              (SZ51) were incubated with platelet lysate from 50 ITP patients
              and 86 controls. The platelet antigen-autoantibody complexes were
              detected by flow cytometry using an FITC-labeled antibody. The
              results were compared with that of a monoclonal antibody
              immobilization of platelet antigen (MAIPA) assay. RESULTS: By
              FCIA, platelet autoantibodies against GPIb, GPIIb, GPIIIa, GPIX
              and P-selectin were detected in ITP patients. Mean fluorescent
              intensity values with antibodies SZ1, SZ2, SZ21, SZ22 and SZ51
              were all higher in ITP patients than controls (p values<0.01). In
              ROC analysis, values of the area under the curve were 0.89, 0.82,
              0.93, 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. In ITP diagnosis, the FCIA
              assay with these five antibodies had better sensitivity and
              accuracy than the MAIPA assay (96\% vs. 44\% in sensitivity;
              80.9\% vs. 64.7\% in accuracy, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: FCIA assays
              with multiple antibodies against platelet GPs may be used to
              improve the diagnosis of ITP in hospitals.",

              remission and 2 patients had complete remission without platelet

              was associated with superior clinical outcomes compared with
              those of high-dose cytarabine in relapse acute myeloid leukemia

              cytarabine and fludarabine therapy for patients with relapsed or
              refractory AML. Patients and Methods: Between January 2008 and
              November 2009, 27 patients were registered in the study. Patients
              had histologically confirmed disease, performance status 0 to 2,
              and adequate organ function. The treatment regimen consisted of
              increasing doses of oxaliplatin (25, 30, or 35 mg/ m2/d) on days
              1 to 4 (escalation phase), and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) and
              cytarabine (500 mg/m2) on days 2 to 6, every 28 days for $\leq$ 6
              cycles. The dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any symptomatic
              grade $\geq$ nonhematologic toxicity lasting $\geq$3 days and
              involving a major organ system. Results: Of 27 patients, 12 were
              treated in the dose-escalation phase and 15 at the maximum
              tolerated dose for oxaliplatin (30 mg/m2; expansion phase). All
              patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Only 1 patient
              received the second cycle; the remaining patients received no
              further study treatment, owing to slow recovery from toxicities
              or physician decision. Grade 3-4 drug-related toxicities included
              diarrhea (grade 4) and elevated levels of bilirubin (grade 3) and
              aspartate transaminase (grade 3). In all, 3 patients had a
              complete remission and 2 patients complete response without
              platelet recovery. Conclusion: Oxaliplatin, cytarabine, and
              fludarabine therapy had antileukemic activity in patients with
              poor-risk AML, but it was associated with toxicity. Different

               devices. The pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease in

              hemostatic mechanisms. The D-dimer (D-D) is the most important
              subproduct of fibrinolysis, and urokinase plasminogen activator
              receptor (uPAR) is related to invasiveness and metastases, and is
              overexpressed in neoplastic cells. The objective of this study
              was to identify in patients with hematological neoplasia, the
              serum levels of uPAR and D-D, and to determine their effects on
              outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was
              performed. Clinical and demographic data were obtained from the
              clinical chart. Determination of uPAR in serum (pg/L) was
              performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and D-D
              ($\mu$g/dL) using nephelometry. RESULTS: We included 42 patients
              (35 with lymphomas). Statistically significant differences were
              found in D-D (P < .001) and uPAR (P < .01) between patients and

              differences in D-D serum levels and soluble uPAR between control
              participants and patients with lymphoma. These results indicate

              Cochrane searches with the terms uterine bleeding, uterine
              hemorrhage, hematologic malignancy. All identified literature
              sources were included in the review. The identified literature is
              largely comprised of case series and pilot studies. No
              evidence-based protocols for gynecologists and hematologists are
              available. The majority of the identified literature centers on
              menstrual suppression with GnRH agonists in hematologic
              malignancy, although no randomized trials could be identified.
              Review of the identified literature suggests that medical
              prevention with GnRH agonist therapy is highly effective for
              prevention of uterine bleeding in hematologic malignancy. With
              respect to treatment of acute uterine bleeding in the setting of
              hematologic malignancy, medical therapy can be used and is
              successful in the majority of patients, according to the
              identified studies. Surgical treatment should be used
              expeditiously if medical treatment options fail to control acute
              bleeding. Empiric prevention and treatment algorithms for the
              discussed clinical settings are proposed. More research is
              necessary on the topic, with the goal to develop evidence-based
              guidelines for gynecology and hematology-oncology care providers.
              Close cooperation between the specialties may improve morbidity
              and mortality associated with uterine bleeding in hematological
              malignancy in the future.",

              investigate the role of GPIb$\alpha$ shedding in the development
              of ITP via incubating normal platelets with ITP plasma to mimic
              ITP in vivo environment. Plasma was isolated from ITP patients or

              measuring GPIb$\alpha$ expression by flow cytometry and western
              blot, ADAM17 expression by western blot, ROS generation and
              platelet activation by flow cytometry. Compared with control

              recommended after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to reduce
              ischemic events but is associated with increased rates of major
              and minor bleeding. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine
              the incidence of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
              bleeding that occurs on contemporary DAPT and its impact on
              quality of life (QOL). METHODS: We studied 9,290 AMI patients
              treated with PCI and discharged alive between April 2010 and
              September 2012. Post-discharge bleeding was categorized according
              to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definition.
              The primary outcome was the 6-month Euro QOL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D)
              index score (a measure of health utility); a secondary outcome
              was the EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) at 6 months. RESULTS: Of
              the 9,290 patients with AMI, bleeding events occurred as follows:
              any BARC bleeding: 24.2\%; BARC 1: 9.1\%; BARC 2: 13.8\%; BARC 3:
              1.1\%; BARC 4: 0.03\%; and BARC 5: 0\%. Those who experienced any
              BARC bleeding had lower scores across all 5 EQ-5D domains
              (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety), as
              well as lower EQ-5D VAS and EQ-5D index scores. After clinical
              risk adjustment, any BARC bleeding was independently associated
              with 6-month EQ-5D index score (p < 0.0001) and lower QOL (p <
              0.001). Both the EQ-5D index and the VAS score declined in a
              stepwise fashion with increasing BARC severity. CONCLUSIONS:
              Among patients undergoing PCI for AMI, bleeding during follow-up
              was associated with worse 6-month utility and QOL. Although even
              minor bleeding was associated with impaired health status and

              [n = 6, 12\%], bile duct [n = 3, 6\%], retroperitoneal [n = 3,
              6\%], and duodenum [n = 2, 4\%]) with 6- to 12-month follow-up.
              Coagulation was evaluated with rotational thromboelastography
              (ROTEM) on whole blood and with a panel of hemostatic markers on
              stored plasma. RESULTS: Maximum clot firmness (MCF) in the
              intrinsic, extrinsic, and fibrinogen pathways increased
              immediately postoperatively and then decreased by 9.2 $\pm$ 4.1
              months (p < 0.05). Markers of thrombin generation (prothrombin
              fragment 1 + 2, fibrinolysis [D-dimer], and endothelial
              activation [coagulation factor VIII]) were elevated at all time
              points. The ROTEM pattern depended on histologic type and cancer
              location. All esophageal tumors were adenocarcinoma and
              demonstrated similar patterns to the overall population, with MCF
              differences over time in all 3 pathways (all p < 0.05). Regarding
              tumors of the pancreas or liver, there were no statistically
              significant differences when comparing all 3 time periods, but
              there were time-related differences when evaluating only primary
              adenocarcinomas of the liver (all p < 0.05). Three patients (6\%)
              developed venous thromboembolism (VTE) and had decreased clot
              formation time, increased angle, and increased MCF (all p <
              0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients at risk for VTE can be
              identified with a point-of-care ROTEM test and may benefit from
              additional anticoagulation. Biomarkers reflecting different
              functional hemostasis activity groups (fibrinolysis, thrombin
              generation, and endothelial activation) confirm the ongoing
              prothrombotic state. The ROTEM demonstrated increased
              hypercoagulability postoperatively, which returned to baseline in
              long-term follow-up. Reversal of cancer-induced
              hypercoagulability occurred in some patients and varied with
              tumor histology and location.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Quality-of-life (QOL) assessments in frequently
              bleeding patients with congenital hemophilia with inhibitors and
              their families are confounded by preexisting arthropathy and
              family circumstances. Periodic QOL assessments typically made on
              nonbleed days may not provide complete reflections of the burden
              on patients/families. AIM: To evaluate the impact of bleeding
              episodes on patients/caregivers/families and the association
              between monthly QOL scores and patients' average diary
              experiences. METHODS: Frequently bleeding inhibitor patients
              ($\geq$four bleeds in 3 months), or their caregivers, provided
              daily assessment of EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire and
              EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire visual analogue scale,
              pain (11-point Likert scale), and family anxiety/stress/activity
              change over 3 to 6 months. QOL scores were stratified by
              bleed/nonbleed days. RESULTS: Patient QOL assessments were
              recorded by 37 of the 39 enrolled patients/caregivers (3771 of
              3777 eligible dairy days, 472 bleed/3299 nonbleed days). Median
              (range) diary duration was 91 (66-180) days, with 8.2\%
              (0\%-72.2\%) bleed days. Mean health scores were significantly
              worse on bleed days than on nonbleed days (P < 0.0001 for all):
              EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire index, 0.66 versus 0.82;
              visual analogue scale health, 69.7 versus 77.4; and pain score,
              4.1 versus 1.8. Bleed days also had higher (P < 0.001)
              proportions of days with abnormalities in family anxiety/stress
              (42\% vs. 30\%) and family activity changes (34\% vs. 21\%).
              CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the impact of hemophilia with inhibitors
              on patient/family QOL typically includes periodic (likely
              nonbleed day) evaluations reflecting baseline abnormalities.
              Daily assessment, however, indicated that frequent acute bleeds
              impair QOL beyond patient's nonbleed day baseline. New approaches
              are required to assess the cumulative impact of frequent acute
              bleeds on patients and their families.",

              bleeding and thrombosis are major complications of APL that lead
              to early death in approximately 10\% of patients despite the
              success of current treatment. This condition may be attributed,
              in part, to the diffuse activation of coagulation,
              hyperfibrinolysis, and non-specific proteolytic activity that is
              observed in patients with APL. Therapeutic agents that induce the
              differentiation of leukemia cells improve outcomes compared with
              those observed using chemotherapy alone. They also correct the
              hyperactivity of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems,
              thereby reducing early death from bleeding. Prophylactic therapy
              with newer anticoagulants may prove beneficial in patients with

              multiple myeloma patients, especially during induction treatment
              with thalidomide in combination with anthracyclines and/or
              dexamethasone. Several coagulation abnormalities have been
              described in untreated myeloma patients, but these have not been
              prospectively evaluated during and after treatment. PATIENTS AND
              METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 138 multiple myeloma
              patients in whom coagulation factor levels were evaluated
              longitudinally before, during induction and after
              intensification. Patients were randomized to induction treatment
              consisting of adriamycin and dexamethason, in combination with
              either vincristin (VAD), thalidomide (TAD), or bortezomib (PAD)
              followed by high-dose melphalan (HDM) and autologous stem cell
              transplant (ASCT). RESULTS: Factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) and von
              Willebrand factor (VWF) were significantly elevated before
              treatment (median FVIII:C 2.26U/ml, VWF:Ag 1.95 U/ml).
              Irrespective of the type of induction regimen, these variables
              increased strongly during induction therapy (FVIII:C 2.55 U/ml
              and VWF:Ag 2.96 U/ml). Fibrinogen also showed a significant
              increase after induction therapy (3.5 g/l pre-treatment and 4.0
              g/l after treatment, respectively, P<0.001). This was
              significantly higher in TAD than VAD treated patients. Three to
              six month after ASCT levels of VWF and FVIII:C had decreased to
              values lower than observed before treatment (1.71 and 1.67 U/ml
              respectively). There was no correlation between the increased
              levels at start and the response of multiple myeloma to
              treatment. High levels of VWF, fibrinogen and FVIII:C before
              start of treatment were significantly associated with mortality.
              Fourteen patients (10\%) developed a venous thrombotic event
              (VTE). The coagulation factor abnormalities before and during
              treatment were not associated with the development of VTE.
              CONCLUSION: During induction treatment several changes in
              coagulation factor levels are observed, which may result in a
              prothrombotic state. Larger studies are required to establish
              whether the changes in these coagulation factors during induction
              treatment contribute to the increased risk of venous
              thromboembolism in multiple myeloma patients.",

              proanthocyanidin, present in a limited number of plants, which
              exhibits a large number of cellular actions mostly derived from
              its antioxidant properties. Cinnamtannin B-1 modulates several
              biological processes such as changes in cytosolic free Ca2+
              concentration, endogenous reactive oxygen species generation,
              protein tyrosine phosphorylation and platelet aggregation.
              Proanthocyanidins, such as cinnamtannin B-1, have been reported
              to exert antitumoral activity mediated by a selective
              proapoptotic action in a number of tumoral cell lines associated
              with antiapoptotic activity in normal cells. The opposite effects
              of proanthocyanidins in normal and tumoral cells suggest that
              these compounds might be the base for therapeutic strategies
              directed selectively against tumoral cells. In addition,
              cinnamtannin B-1 shows antithrombotic actions through inhibition,
              in platelets, of endogenous ROS generation, Ca2+ mobilization
              and, subsequently, aggregation. This has been reported to be
              especially relevant in platelets from diabetic patients, where
              cinnamtannin B-1 reverses both platelet hypersensitivity and
              hyperactivity. Considering the large number of cellular effects
              of cinnamtannin B-1 the development of therapeutic strategies for
              thrombotic disorders or certain types of cancer deserves further
              studies. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the

  abstract = "In response to vessel injury (or other pathological conditions),
              the hemostatic process is activated, resulting in a fibrous,
              cellular-rich structure commonly referred to as a blood clot.
              Succeeding the clot's function in wound healing, it must be
              resolved. This illustrated review focuses on fibrinolysis-the
              degradation of blood clots or thrombi. Fibrin is the main
              mechanical and structural component of a blood clot, which
              encases the cellular components of the clot, including platelets
              and red blood cells. Fibrinolysis is the proteolytic degradation
              of the fibrin network that results in the release of the cellular
              components into the bloodstream. In the case of thrombosis,
              fibrinolysis is required for restoration of blood flow, which is
              accomplished clinically through exogenously delivered lytic
              factors in a process called external lysis. Fibrinolysis is
              regulated by plasminogen activators (tissue-type and
              urokinase-type) that convert plasminogen into plasmin to initiate
              fiber lysis and lytic inhibitors that impede this lysis
              (plasminogen activator inhibitors, alpha 2-antiplasmin, and
              thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor). Furthermore, the
              network structure has been shown to regulate lysis: thinner
              fibers and coarser clots lyse faster than thicker fibers and
              finer clots. Clot contraction, a result of platelets pulling on
              fibers, results in densely packed red blood cells
              (polyhedrocytes), reduced permeability to fibrinolytic factors,
              and increased fiber tension. Extensive research in the field has
              allowed for critical advancements leading to improved
              thrombolytic agents. In this review, we summarize the state of

              II cell surface and mRNA expression in a range of acute myeloid
              leukaemia (AML) cell lines. The evidence that annexin II levels
              are higher in APL would lend support to the hypothesis that the
              bleeding disorder seen in APL is caused by hyperfibrinolysis.
              RESULTS: Cell surface annexin II was found to be expressed at
              higher levels on NB4 (promyelocytic) cells than on either KG1a
              (early myeloid) or HL60 (myelocytic) cells. However, even higher
              levels were found on U937 and MM6 (histo-monocytic) and HEL
              (erythroid) cells (p<0.01). MM6 cells showed a threefold increase
              in annexin II mRNA compared to any of the other cell lines.
              CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not fully support the concept of
              the coagulopathy associated with APL being caused by
              hyperfibrinolysis alone. Further investigations are required to
              identify the significance of annexin II expression and regulation
              in leukaemia.",

              activation and microparticle formation in thrombocytopenia and
              thrombocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood was obtained from
              normal subjects or subjects with immune thrombocytopenic purpura
              (ITP), myelodysplasia (MDS) or essential thrombocythaemia (ET).
              Platelet activation and microparticle formation were assessed in
              resting and agonist stimulated samples. RESULTS: Platelet
              activation was significantly decreased in MDS in
              agonist-stimulated platelets when compared to normals and ITP,
              however increased microparticle-to-platelet ratios were found.
              Absolute platelet-derived microparticle counts were significantly

              of clot retraction and the fibrinolysis rate in whole blood from
              48 PV patients and 48 healthy controls. Measurements were
              performed before and after isovolemic eryhrocytapheresis (ECP).
              CR was measured by optical method. Clot lysis time (CLT) and
              maximum clot firmness (MCF) were measured by thromboelastometry
              in recalcified blood supplemented with t-PA and tissue factor.
              Compared with healthy controls, CR rate in PV patients was higher
              (0.0219 vs. 0.0138; p0.3). Compared with healthy controls, CLT in

              recognized as a thrombophilic disorder. However, no further
              investigation of risk factors has been conducted to date. This
              study evaluated classic and disease-specific correlates of
              thrombosis among ITP patients. We hypothesized the
              disease-specific thrombosis risk profile differed between ITP and
              non-ITP patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of adult
              discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample between 2009
              and 2014 was performed. International Disease Classification
              codes were used to identify ITP and non-ITP patients with or
              without thrombosis. Estimates of prevalence were weighted using
              NIS-provided discharge-level weights to reflect national
              estimates. Rao-Scott Chi-square test was used to analyze
              categoric variables; weighted simple linear regression for
              continuous variables; and a weighted multivariable logistic
              regression to determine covariates associated with thrombosis.
              RESULTS: Thrombotic risk factors are increased in ITP patients,
              including postoperative state, malignancy, central venous lines,
              systemic lupus erythematosus, advanced age, obesity, and
              hypertension. Factors associated with thrombosis identified in
              multivariable logistic regression included antiphospholipid
              syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, central venous lines,
              obesity, and hypertension, which were similar to non-ITP
              patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a higher prevalence of
              thrombosis in ITP than in non-ITP patients, and despite their
              lower platelet counts, correlates of thrombosis are similar
              between ITP and non-ITP patients. The most significant correlates
              include antiphospholipid syndrome, central venous lines, surgery,

              impact of risk factors for AT and VTE in patients with primary
              ITP in France and Sweden. METHODS: Both countries have national
              health databases, including hospital diagnoses and drug
              dispensing data. Adults with incident primary ITP identified
              using algorithms between the years 2009-2015 in France, and
              2009-2016 in Sweden were included. Cumulative incidence rates
              (IR) of AT and VTE were calculated by risk factors and
              multivariable Cox models were used to estimate associations.
              RESULTS: The study included 7225 patients from France and 2490
              from Sweden. The IR of AT were 15.0 (95\% CI: 13.4-16.7) and 14.7

              linked administrative data and a validated algorithm we
              identified VTE cases in Alberta, Canada from 2003 to 2015.
              Subjects having International Classification of Diseases code for

              year before and after the VTE index event were defined as cancer
              associated VTE cases. We also identified patients with no VTE.
              Cox proportional hazards model was applied to estimate the hazard
              ratio (HR) of death. Kaplan Meier analysis was performed to
              compare survival rate between different groups. RESULTS: We

              fibrinogen to fibrin. Previous in vitro studies have shown that
              the thrombin concentration present during clot formation dictates
              the ultimate fibrin structure. In most prior studies of fibrin
              structure, clotting was initiated by adding thrombin to a
              solution of fibrinogen; however, clot formation in vivo occurs in
              an environment in which the concentration of free thrombin
              changes over the reaction course. These changes depend on local
              cellular properties and available concentrations of pro- and
              anti-coagulants. Recent studies suggest that abnormal thrombin
              generation patterns produce abnormally structured clots that are
              associated with an increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis.

  abstract  = "AbstractPlatelets are a critical component for effecting
               hemostasis and wound healing. Disorders affecting any platelet
               pathway mediating adhesion, activation, aggregation and
               procoagulant surface exposure can result in a bleeding
               diathesis. Specific diagnosis even with advanced techniques
               which are unavailable to most centers is often difficult.
               Inherited platelet function disorders therefore represent a
               heterogeneous and complex collection of disorders with a
               spectrum of bleeding severity, from relatively mild (and easily
               missed or misdiagnosed) to severe bleeding phenotype with
               salient diagnostic features. We advocate the use of bleeding
               assessment tools to help identification of patients and more
               importantly for assessment of individual patient bleeding
               phenotype to guide management decisions for treating and
               preventing bleeding. The complex management of these patients is
               best coordinated in a multidisciplinary comprehensive care
               clinic setting expert in managing bleeding disorders and
               associated complications, with particular attention to the
               physical and psychosocial health of patients and their families.
               Depending on the bleeding phenotype, the location and severity
               of bleeding, and the nature of an invasive procedure, available
               treatment modalities range from conservative measures using
               local pressure, topical thrombin, fibrin sealant,
               antifibrinolytics etc. to the use of systemic haemostatics such
               as desmopressin (DDAVP), platelets and recombinant human
               activated factor VII (rFVIIa). This review will provide opinions
               on the practical aspects and general management of inherited
               platelet function disorders, with discussion on the mechanism of
               action, and the pros and cons of various hemostatic agents.
               Finally, the prospect of curative treatment for patients with
               severe bleeding phenotype refractory to available treatments and
               with poor quality of life will be briefly discussed.",

              reconstitution following high-dose chemotherapy for malignancy.
              Some patients seem to have an imbalance of the immune response
              after SCT and cytokines are known to regulate this response.
              Recently, platelets have been shown to contain members of the
              chemokine family, suggesting a role of platelets as inflammatory
              cells. We measured and compared levels of platelet activation
              markers, chemokines, and soluble factors in patients undergoing
              SCT. IL-8 and GRO$\alpha$ exhibited a significant elevation in
              the early phase (1 or 2 weeks) after SCT; this trend was marked
              after autologous SCT. Furthermore, these levels significantly and
              positively correlated with the change in G-CSF. In contrast,
              ENA-78 exhibited a significant elevation in the later phase (3 or
              4 weeks) after SCT. In addition, its level negatively correlated
              with the change in G-CSF. Soluble CD40 ligand and
              platelet-derived microparticles significantly increased after
              both auto- and allo-SCT. In addition, ENA-78 positively
              correlated with the level of platelet-derived microparticles. The
              increase of RANTES seems to be related to platelet activation,
              since RANTES was in the dynamic phase similar to soluble CD40
              ligand and platelet-derived microparticles. RANTES exhibited
              changes similar to IL-6, TNF$\alpha$, and soluble IL-2 receptors,
              which are GVHD markers. Thus, the platelet-derived chemokines
              ENA-78 and RANTES exhibited particular changes after SCT. Our
              results suggest that ENA-78 play a role in hematopoietic
              conditions in which G-CSF is not involved, and RANTES generation
              after allo-SCT relates to GVHD. \copyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

              variety of acute thrombotic events and coronary heart diseases.
              Few studies have examined the effects of arsenic trioxide on
              platelets, and the mechanisms underlying the signaling pathways
              remain obscure. The aim of this study was to examine
              systematically the detailed mechanisms of arsenic trioxide in
              preventing platelet activation. Arsenic trioxide (5 micromol/L)
              exhibited more potent activity at inhibiting collagen (1
              microg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation than other agonists.
              Arsenic trioxide (15 and 25 micromol/L) inhibited
              collagen-induced platelet activation accompanied by [Ca(+2)]i
              mobilization, thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) formation, phospholipase
              C (PLC)gamma 2 phosphorylation, and protein kinase C (PKC)
              activation. Arsenic trioxide (15 and 25 micromol/L) did not
              significantly affect cyclic nucleotide-induced
              vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation. Moreover,
              arsenic trioxide markedly inhibited p38 mitogen-activated protein
              kinase (MAPK) but not JNK1/2 or ERK2 phosphorylation in washed
              platelets. Arsenic trioxide also markedly reduced hydroxyl
              radical (OH(.)) formation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate
              (ESR) study. The most important findings of this study suggest
              that the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide possibly involves
              inhibition of the PLC gamma 2-PKC-p38 MAPK cascade, thereby
              leading to inhibition of [Ca(+2)]i or free radical formation, and
              finally the inhibition of platelet aggregation.",

              generation on the surface of endothelial cells, which line the
              blood vessel wall. As a co-receptor for plasminogen and tissue
              plasminogen activator (tPA), which are key factors in plasmin
              generation, the annexin A2 (A2) complex promotes vascular
              fibrinolysis. The intracellular A2 complex is a heterotetramer of
              two A2 monomers and two copies of the associated protein, p11. In
              response to endothelial cell activation, A2 is phosphorylated by
              src-kinase, and translocated to the cell surface in a highly
              regulated manner. Over-expression of A2 is seen in acute
              promyelocytic leukemia during the early hemorrhagic phase, while
              high titer antibodies to A2, as in antiphospholipid syndrome or
              cerebral venous thrombosis, are associated with thrombosis. In
              experimental hyperhomocysteinemia, moreover, derivatization of A2
              by homocysteine leads to intravascular fibrin accumulation and
              dysangiogenesis, features that phenocopy the Anxa2(-/-) mouse.
              Exogenous A2 may also offer a novel therapeutic approach to

              conjunction with conventional tPA-based thrombolytic therapy

              bone marrow, the disturbed balance between osteoclasts and
              osteoblasts is important for the development of lytic lesions.
              However, the mechanisms behind myeloma-mediated bone destruction
              are not completely understood. In order to address the importance
              of myeloma cell-osteoclast interactions in MM pathogenesis, we
              have developed a functional coculture system. We found that
              myeloma-osteoclast interactions resulted in stimulation of
              myeloma cell growth and osteoclastic activity through activation
              of major signalling pathways and upregulation of proteases.
              Signals from osteoclasts activated the p44/p42 MAPK, STAT3 and
              PI3K/Akt pathways in myeloma cells. In turn, myeloma cells
              triggered p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signalling in osteoclasts.
              Myeloma-osteoclast interactions stimulated the production of
              TRAP, cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -9, and

              demonstrated the critical role of myeloma cell-osteoclast
              interactions in the existing interdependence between tumour

              (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and to make comparison with
              polyglobulia (PG). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor
              plasma (PPP) were analyzed by an in vitro clot lysis test.
              Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity was measured
              in plasma and in the supernatants of the washed and gel-filtered

              increased lysis resistance after retraction was not observed in

              partly caused by higher plasmatic PAI-1 activity as well as by

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Successful management of bleeding disorders after
              congenital heart surgery requires detection of specific
              coagulation disturbances. Whole-blood rotation thromboelastometry
              (RoTEM\textregistered{}) provides continuous qualitative
              haemostatic profiles, and the technique has shown promising
              results in adult cardiac surgery. SETTING: To compare the
              performance of RoTEM\textregistered{} with that of conventional
              coagulation tests in children, we conducted a descriptive study
              in children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. For that
              purpose, 60 children were enrolled and had blood samples taken
              before, immediately after, and 1 day after surgery. Conventional
              coagulation tests included: activated partial thromboplastin
              time, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin D-dimer, thrombin
              clotting time, factor XIII, and platelet count. RESULTS:
              Post-surgical haemostatic impairment was present to some degree
              in all children, as seen by pronounced changes in activated
              partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin clotting
              time, and platelet count, as well as RoTEM\textregistered{}
              analysis. RoTEM\textregistered{} showed marked changes in
              clotting time - prolonged by 7-18\% - clot formation time -
              prolonged by 46-71\% - maximum clot firmness - reduced by
              10-19\%, and maximum velocity - reduced by 29-39\%. Comparison of
              the two techniques showed that conventional coagulation tests and
              RoTEM\textregistered{} performed equally well with regard to
              negative predictive values for excessive post-operative drain
              production - more than 20 millilitres per kilogram per 24 hours
              after surgery - with an area under the curve of approximately
              0.65. CONCLUSION: RoTEM\textregistered{} can detect haemostatic
              impairments in children undergoing cardiac surgery and the method
              should be considered as a supplement in the perioperative care of
              the children where targeted transfusion therapy is necessary to
              avoid volume overload.",

              opaque gels varies as the inverse third power of the wavelength,
              lambda. Mass-length ratios of the fibers calculated from these
              two measurements closely agree. For fibrin gels containing fibers

              It is shown how the radius of gyration of the fiber cross section

              P-selectin recognizes both lineage-specific carbohydrate ligands

              Several other JAK inhibitors are in development with some
              currently undergoing phase-3 clinical trial testing. None of the
              currently available JAK inhibitors are specific to mutant JAK2;
              their mechanism of action involves attenuation of JAK-STAT
              signaling with downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines,
              rather than selective suppression of the disease clone.
              Accordingly, while ruxolitinib and other JAK inhibitors are
              effective in controlling splenomegaly and alleviating
              constitutional symptoms, their benefit in terms of reversing bone

              sex, karyotype and disease status at transplant. With a median

              the 2- and 5-year overall survival, with or without alemtuzumab,
              is 60 and 60\% (P=0.80) and 61 and 53\%, respectively (P=0.85).
              The 2-year non-relapse mortality is 12\% with alemtuzumab, and
              17\% without alemtuzumab (P=0.49). The 2-year relapse rate is
              35\% with alemtuzumab compared with 19\% without alemtuzumab

              conclusion, alemtuzumab has a beneficial effect by reducing
              chronic GVHD without affecting overall survival. Further studies

              from clinical data. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is often
              invoked as the cause of renal injury. Patients >2 years old
              undergoing their first HCT at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research

              plasma markers of coagulation activation, (PAI-1 and tPA) and
              fibrinolyis (D-dimer) weekly in 149 patients during the first 100
              days post transplant. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used
              to determine associations between these markers and AKI (doubling
              of baseline serum creatinine). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
              determine the associations between day 100 urinary albumin to
              creatinine ratios and these markers. Thirty one percent of
              patients developed AKI. Though elevations in these markers
              occurred frequently, neither PAI-1 nor tPA were associated with

              increased risk of AKI (relative risk=1.76; P-value 0.04). None of
              these markers were associated with micro-or macroalbuminuria at

  abstract = "Background: Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (FC) or
              immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an essential tool for identifying
              cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with megakaryoblastic
              differentiation. Demonstration of the megakaryocytic markers
              CD41, CD42b, and/or CD61 on blasts is used to identify
              megakaryoblasts. However, it is unclear which of these markers
              may be most relevant. Moreover, previous studies have not
              compared the sensitivity of FC to IHC in detecting
              megakaryoblasts. Design: We retrospectively identified cases with
              increased myeloblasts (CD34 and/or CD117 positive) expressing at
              least one megakaryocyte-associated antigen reviewed between
              1/2008 and 7/2011. Cases in which CD42b and CD61 were performed
              initially, or those with frozen cells available for additional
              studies were included. When paraffin blocks were available, IHC
              for CD42b and CD61 was performed on core biopsies and particle
              clots. Five-color FC immunophenotyping was performed using an
              FC500 cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Results: A total of 13 cases
              were identified (12 AML and 1 RAEB-2). Of the AML cases, 2 were
              in patients with trisomy 21, while the others were AML NOS. CD41
              was analyzed by FC on 10/13 cases, CD61 on 13/13 cases, and CD42b
              on 13/13 cases. All cases were positive for CD61 (13/13) and CD41
              (10/13). The majority of cases were negative for CD42b (8/13).
              Expression of CD42b on blasts was weaker than that seen on
              platelets, a helpful feature in excluding platelet adhesion to
              blasts. Eight of 13 cases had core biopsies available for IHC
              studies, and 5 of these had particle clots. The blasts were
              negative for CD61 in 8/8 cases, in contrast to the CD61
              expression observed by FC. CD42b showed weak, focal staining in
              2/8 cases, which were also CD42b positive by FC. There was no
              difference in CD61 and CD42b staining between the cores and
              clots, suggesting that decalcification does not negatively affect
              antigen expression. Conclusions: Immunophenotyping by FC is more
              sensitive than IHC for detection of CD42b and CD61 on
              myeloblasts. The use of FC is important to include in diagnostic
              testing panels for AML to identify cases with megakaryocytic
              differentiation that may be missed by IHC alone. Evaluation of
              CD42b is useful in some cases to confirm that CD41 and CD61
              expression is a property of the blast population. Given that
              megakaryoblasts in this series either lacked or expressed weak
              CD42b as compared with platelets, it is unlikely that the
              presence of CD41 and CD61 was due to platelet adherence to
              blasts.",

              primarily to identify acute leukemia/ sarcoma with megakaryocytic

              also detected in a subset of acute leukemia with no
              megakaryocytic differentiation secondary to platelet adhesion to
              myeloblasts. Here, we report the incidence of CD61 detection in
              acute myeloid leukemia without megakaryocytic differentiation.
              Design: A natural language search was performed in our database

              Blood and bone marrow samples from 176 cases of acute myeloid

  abstract = "Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are
              myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which generally follow a
              benign and indolent clinical course. However, venous thromboses
              are common and constitute the main cause of morbidity and
              mortality. The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation and other
              biomarkers has advanced our understanding of these diseases.
              There is a strong association between the presence of the
              JAK2V617F mutation and the development of thrombosis in ET. If
              venous thrombosis presents with unusual manifestations, the
              diagnosis of a MPN, such as PV or ET, should be part of the
              differentials. Treatment of venous thrombosis in MPN follows the
              same principle as in other patients with venous thrombosis, but
              careful attention to primary and secondary prophylaxis in
              addition to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be given.
              Cytoreductive therapy is indicated in high-risk subgroups of PV
              and ET patients, and alternative therapeutic agents have
              different effects on risk of venous thrombosis. New therapeutic
              approaches are emerging, and JAK2 inhibitors, histone deacetylase
              inhibitors and next-generation anticoagulants are in various
              stages of clinical development for the treatment of MPN, but
              their exact role in thrombosis prevention and treatment remains
              unclear. \copyright{} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All

              understood. As previously reported, activation of the complement
              cascade (ComC) and cleavage of C5 by C5 convertase are enabling
              events in the release of C5a that plays a crucial role in the
              egress of HSPCs from bone marrow (BM) into peripheral blood (PB)
              and explains why C5-deficient mice are poor mobilizers. Here we
              provide evidence that during granulocyte colony-stimulating
              factor- and AMD3100-induced mobilization, not only the ComC but
              also two other evolutionarily ancient proteolytic enzyme
              cascades, the coagulation cascade (CoaC) and the fibrynolytic
              cascade (FibC), become activated. Activation of all three
              cascades was measured by generation of C5a, decrease in
              prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time as
              well as an increase in the concentrations of plasmin/antiplasmin
              and thrombin/antithrombin. More importantly, the CoaC and FibC,
              by generating thrombin and plasmin, respectively, provide C5
              convertase activity, explaining why mobilization of HSPCs in
              C3-deficient mice, which do not generate ComC-generated C5a
              convertase, is not impaired. Our observations shed more light on
              how the CoaC and FibC modulate stem cell mobilization and may
              lead to the development of more efficient mobilization strategies
              in poor mobilizers. Furthermore, as it is known that all these
              cascades are activated in all the situations in which HSPCs are
              mobilized from BM into PB (for example, infections, tissue/organ
              damage or strenuous exercise) and show a circadian rhythm of
              activation, they must be involved in both stress-induced and

              only the short isoform in seven affected males from two
              generations of a family. Hematological profiles of affected males
              demonstrate macrocytic anemia, normal platelet counts and

              support normal erythropoiesis. Moreover, this is the first study

              demonstrated an association between chemotherapy dose intensity
              and both clinical efficacy and toxicity. The optimum tolerable
              and effective dose and schedule of chemotherapeutic agents is
              based on data from dose-finding studies and early clinical
              trials. There is considerable evidence that reductions in the
              recommended dose intensity often occurs in actual clinical
              practice, particularly among overweight and obese patients with
              cancer. With increasing rates of obesity, and variation and
              uncertainty about appropriate dosing of chemotherapy in obese
              patients, ASCO has generated clinical practice guidelines for
              appropriate chemotherapy dosing for obese adult patients with
              cancer. Without evidence of any increase in treatment-related
              toxicity among obese patients receiving chemotherapy, the
              guidelines recommend that, after considering any accompanying
              comorbidities, chemotherapy dosing should be calculated based on
              body surface area using actual weight, rather than an estimate or
              idealization of weight. While further research is needed,

              haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disease that presents with
              haemolytic anaemia, thrombosis and smooth muscle dystonias, as
              well as bone marrow failure in some cases. PNH is caused by
              somatic mutations in PIGA (which encodes phosphatidylinositol
              N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A) in one or more HSC
              clones. The gene product of PIGA is required for the biosynthesis
              of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors; thus, PIGA
              mutations lead to a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins, such as
              complement decay-accelerating factor (also known as CD55) and
              CD59 glycoprotein (CD59), which are both complement inhibitors.
              Clinical manifestations of PNH occur when a HSC clone carrying
              somatic PIGA mutations acquires a growth advantage and
              differentiates, generating mature blood cells that are deficient
              of GPI-anchored proteins. The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH
              erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can
              lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of
              PNH. The accumulation of anaphylatoxins (such as C5a) from
              complement activation might also have a role. The natural history
              of PNH is highly variable, ranging from quiescent to
              life-threatening. Therapeutic strategies include terminal
              complement blockade and bone marrow transplantation. Eculizumab,

              underlying the hemostatic anomalies of APL are not completely
              elucidated. RNA-sequencing-based characterization of APL (n = 30)
              was performed and compared to that of other acute myeloid
              leukemia (n = 400) samples and normal promyelocytes.
              Perturbations in the transcriptome of coagulation and
              fibrinolysis-related genes in APL extend beyond known culprits
              and now include Thrombin, Factor X and Urokinase Receptor. Most
              intriguingly, the Podoplanin (PDPN) gene, involved in platelet
              aggregation, is aberrantly expressed in APL promyelocytes and is
              the most distinctive transcript for this disease. Using an
              antibody panel optimized for AML diagnosis by flow cytometry, we
              also found that PDPN was the most specific surface marker for
              APL, and that all-trans retinoic acid therapy rapidly decreases
              its expression. Functional studies showed that engineered
              overexpression of this gene in human leukemic cells causes
              aberrant platelet binding, activation and aggregation.
              PDPN-expressing primary APL cells, but not PDPN-negative primary
              leukemias, specifically induce platelet binding, activation and
              aggregation. Finally, PDPN expression on leukemia cells in a
              xenograft model was associated with thrombocytopenia and
              prolonged bleeding time in vivo. Together our results suggest

              substantial improvements in cancer treatment, the risk of VTE has
              increased in recent years; VTE rates additionally depend on the
              type of cancer (with pancreas, stomach and primary brain tumours
              having the highest risk) as well as on individual patient's and
              cancer treatment factors. Multiple cancer-specific mechanisms of
              VTE have been identified and can be classified as mechanisms in
              which the tumour expresses proteins that alter host systems, such
              as levels of platelets and leukocytes, and in which the tumour
              expresses procoagulant proteins released into the circulation
              that directly activate the coagulation cascade or platelets, such
              as tissue factor and podoplanin, respectively. As signs and
              symptoms of VTE may be non-specific, diagnosis requires clinical
              assessment, evaluation of pre-test probability, and objective
              diagnostic testing with ultrasonography or CT. Risk assessment
              tools have been validated to identify patients at risk of VTE.
              Primary prevention of VTE (thromboprophylaxis) has long been

  abstract = "It is recognised that platelets respond differently to
              activation, where a subpopulation of platelets adopt a
              procoagulant phenotype while others are aggregatory. However, it
              has not been thoroughly tested whether these subpopulations will
              remain in maximally activated samples, or if they are merely a
              result of different platelet sensitivities to agonist activation.
              Here platelets were activated with gradually increasing
              concentrations of thrombin and/or the GPVI agonist cross-linked
              collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL). Platelet activation was
              investigated using a novel six-colour flow cytometry protocol
              evaluating exposure of phosphatidylserine, active conformation of
              the fibrinogen receptor $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, $\alpha$-granule and
              lysosomal release (P-selectin and LAMP-1 exposure), mitochondrial
              membrane integrity and platelet fragmentation. Upon activation by
              CRP-XL or thrombin+CRP-XL, platelets formed three differently
              sized subpopulations. Normal-sized platelets showed high exposure
              of aggregatory active $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 and intact
              mitochondria, while the smaller platelets and platelet fragments
              showed high exposure of procoagulant phosphatidylserine. The
              distribution of platelets between the differently sized
              subpopulations remained stable despite high agonist
              concentrations. All three were still present after 30 and 60 min
              of activation, showing that all platelets will not have the same
              characteristics even after maximal stimulation. This suggests
              that platelet subpopulations with distinct activation patterns
              exist within the total platelet population.",

              platelet transfusion refractoriness following autoBMT; we
              therefore retrospectively analyzed 39 AML patients for this
              complication following BMT. All patients received high-dose
              chemoradiotherapy, followed by infusion of allogeneic sibling
              donor (n = 12, alloBMT) or autologous (n = 27, autoBMT) stem
              cells. HLA alloimmunization was assessed if patients were
              suspected of immune refractoriness to random donor platelet
              transfusions. Within 100 days of stem cell infusion, one of three

              incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the
              sibling than in the twin group (38 vs 27\%; P = 0.05). The 5 year
              cumulative incidence of relapse was 32\% (95\% CI: 29-35\%) for
              the siblings and 39\% (95\% CI: 26-60\%; P = 0.6) for the twins.
              A trend for better 5-years disease-free and overall survival was
              observed in the twin group: 34\% (95\% CI: 14-54\%) Ps 28\% (95\%

              stem cell transplantation from identical twins had a lower TRM:
              HR: 0.4 (95\% CI: 0.2-0.9; P=0.03). The relapse rate was similar
              for both groups with a HR of 1.2 (95\% CI: 0.07-2.1; P=0.5), with
              a better survival for the twins: HR 0.6 (95\% CI: 0.4-1.0;

              DESIGN: 12-week multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled,
              randomized parallel groups design. Study conducted at three
              clinical sites in New York State. Subjects were randomized to

              (30<BMI</=39.9 kg/m(2)) volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65
              y. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight, percent body fat, fat mass,
              waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, and pulse measured at 2
              days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks

              treatment experienced, on average, an additional 1.5 kg of weight
              loss compared with subjects receiving the placebo. In addition,
              subjects receiving the 'active' treatment experienced greater
              reductions in BMI and waist circumference over the 12-week

              lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving intensive multi-agent
              chemotherapy. In CALGB study 8811 (Blood 1995; 85: 2025-2037),
              197 adults were scheduled to receive 14 doses of Escherichia coil
              L-asparaginase (6000 U/m2 SC) during 7 of the first 12 weeks of
              chemotherapy. No further L-asparaginase was given. Chemotherapy
              was given for 24 months. The median follow-up time has been 5.7
              years. Of the 141 patients who remained on study after 12 weeks,
              82 (58\%) had received all 14 planned doses; 38 (27\%) had 12-13
              L-asparaginase doses documented in their treatment record; 21
              (15\%) patients had received < or =11 doses due to a variety of
              toxic effects. The mean number of doses received prior to
              experiencing any hypersensitivity reaction was seven (range
              1-11). Seven patients had mild hypersensitivity reactions, but
              all seven eventually received 12-14 doses of E. coil
              L-asparaginase. Twenty-one other patients had severe
              hypersensitivity reactions that required discontinuation of E.
              coil L-asparaginase; 20 of these patients were switched to
              Erwinia L-asparaginase to complete their treatment. Ultimately,
              12 of these 20 patients received 14 doses of L-asparaginase in
              total, and six received 12-13 doses. Thus, only three of the 21
              patients who had severe hypersensitivity reactions received < or
              =11 total L-asparaginase doses. Other L-asparaginase-related
              complications included pancreatitis (15 patients),
              hypofibrinogenemia <100mg/dl (29 patients), and deep venous
              thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (eight patients); some of these
              patients had L-asparaginase discontinued after these
              complications. The estimates for LFS at 3 years were 55\% (95\%
              confidence interval, 44-65\%) for the patients who received all
              14 L-asparaginase doses (median LFS, 5.1 years), 47\% (95\% CI,
              33-62\%) for those who received 12-13 doses, and 48\% (95\% CI,
              29-67\%) for those who received < or =11 doses. There were no
              significant differences between these three groups in the length
              of LFS (P=0.68). LFS did not correlate with a history of severe
              hypersensitivity reaction (P=0.67). In general, E. coil
              L-asparaginase was well tolerated in these adult patients, and
              most patients received all of the planned therapy. Patients who
              had mild L-asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions and patients
              who switched to Erwinia L-asparaginase because of more severe
              allergic reactions did not have significantly shorter LFS than
              the remaining adults treated on this ALL protocol. The

              paralleled the correction of plasma fibrinogen level and
              amelioration of bleeding symptoms. Notably, clinical improvement
              was also correlated to ATRA/As2O3-induced rapid decrease of
              membrane procoagulant activity (PCA) and TF contents of APL
              blasts. Consistent with the in vivo findings, the membrane PCA,
              TF antigen and its mRNA level within NB4 cells were rapidly
              down-regulated by 1 microM ATRA or As2O3, while 0.2 microg/ml DNR
              increased these TF parameters prior to its effect upon apoptosis
              induction. The down-regulation of TF mRNA by ATRA was partially
              de novo protein synthesis-dependent and at least partially
              attributed to a mechanism of destabilizing TF mRNA. On the other
              hand, in addition to its modulation on mRNA, As2O3 could also
              induce an accelerated TF protein turnover. These distinct effects
              were corroborated with the properties of these agents in causing
              the degradation of PML-RARalpha protein. All three therapeutic
              agents, however, enhanced the potential of NB4 cells to stimulate
              the expression of TF and PCA in endothelium. Taken together, our
              data suggest that the rapid and distinct regulation of TF on APL
              cells by these therapeutic agents might at least partially
              contribute to their effects on APL coagulopathy.",

              calculate RS for FICH, one point was assigned for each risk

              (Phe(33)-Asp(339)), which is involved in phospholipid binding.
              Annexin A2 has been implicated in a number of biochemical
              processes, including cell proliferation, foetal immune tolerance,
              ion-channel activation, cell-cell interactions and the bridging

              pathological processes such as haemostasis and metastasis.
              Myeloid cell lines are used, extensively, to study many aspects
              of cellular proliferation, differentiation and function. In the

              distinguished from other leukaemias by the high potential for
              early haemorrhagic death. Several processes are involved, such as
              disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperfibrinolysis.
              Recently, TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) was
              identified as a link between coagulation and fibrinolysis. TAFI
              can be activated by thrombin, and in its activated form potently
              attenuates fibrinolysis by removing C-terminal lysine and
              arginine residues that are important for the binding and
              activation of plasminogen. Activation of TAFI by the coagulation
              system results in a down-regulation of fibrinolytic activity and,
              thereby, prevents a rapid dissolution of the fibrin clot. To
              establish whether TAFI was involved in the severity of the
              bleeding complications in APL, the TAFI antigen and activity
              levels were determined in a group of 15 patients. The TAFI
              antigen concentration was normal, but the activity of TAFI was
              severely reduced in APL by approximately 60\%. The reduction of
              TAFI activity was most probably caused by the action of plasmin
              on TAFI because in vitro experiments revealed that plasmin
              slightly reduced antigen levels but severely reduced TAFI
              activity. The acquired functional TAFI deficiency in APL may
              contribute to the severity of the haemorrhagic diathesis because
              of the impaired capacity of the coagulation system to protect the

              Soluble uPA was present in cell line supernatants and lysates in

              tetraspanin protein CD9 stimulates the degranulation of platelets
              and eosinophils, although the mechanism of activation is unclear.
              In this work we transfected human CD9 into the rat basophilic
              leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cell line and studied the stimulation of
              secretion from these cells in response to a panel of anti-CD9
              antibodies. Intact immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies activated
              transfected cells whereas F(ab')2 fragments of antibody and an
              intact IgG2a did not. Stimulation of secretion was inhibited by
              co-incubation with monomer murine immunoglobulin E (IgE) but not
              with an IgG1 isotype control, indicating that the response
              involves the endogenous high-affinity IgE receptor
              (Fc$\epsilon$RI). The anti-CD9 antibody activation curve was
              biphasic, and supraoptimal antibody concentrations stimulated
              little or no degranulation, indicating that multivalent binding
              of human CD9 molecules is necessary for the formation of an
              active complex with rat Fc$\epsilon$RI. Immunoprecipitation of
              Fc$\epsilon$RI under mild detergent conditions co-precipitated
              CD9, suggesting the presence of pre-existing complexes of CD9 and
              Fc$\epsilon$RI that could be activated by antibody cross-linking.
              These data are further evidence that tetraspanins are involved in
              Fc$\epsilon$RI signalling and may reflect the participation of
              tetraspanins in the formation of complexes with other membrane
              proteins that use components of Fe receptors for signal
              transduction.",

              which the apheresis donor determines platelet recovery after
              transfusion, to measure the impact of ABO identity, and to
              predict outcome by evaluating the donor. STUDY DESIGN AND
              METHODS: The percentage of platelet recovery was measured after
              prophylactic transfusion of apheresis units divided from single
              donors to paired recipients with uncomplicated thrombocytopenia
              secondary to leukemia chemotherapy. Platelet microaggregation
              induced by citrate was measured at the time of apheresis.
              RESULTS: Platelet recoveries in paired recipients correlated
              strongly when both transfusions were ABO-identical. When one
              recipient was ABO-identical and the other was ABO-nonidentical,
              nonidentical transfusions yielded one-third the recovery of
              ABO-identical transfusions. In ABO-identical transfusions,
              platelet recovery in donors having microaggregates in the
              before-apheresis ACD sample was one-third that in donors without
              microaggregates. This difference was observed at 1 and 24 hours.
              Expression of P-selectin in the apheresis units at the time of
              transfusion correlated well with ACD microaggregates in the
              before-apheresis sample. CONCLUSION: When transfusions of
              platelets are ABO-identical, donor quality dominates recovery in
              circulation. Donor quality is predicted by a rapid and simple
              assay of citrate-induced microaggregation performed at the time
              of apheresis. When donor quality is factored out, ABO identity
              prevails.",

              In this study, the role of the recently discovered inhibitor of
              fibrinolysis, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI)
              in cirrhosis was examined. METHODS: In 64 patients with cirrhosis
              of varying severity, TAFI antigen levels were measured by
              enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with TAFI levels
              in control subjects. Furthermore, a plasma-based fibrinolysis
              assay was performed in the presence and absence of a specific
              inhibitor of activated TAFI. RESULTS: TAFI levels were decreased
              in cirrhosis. Mean TAFI levels were 66\% in Child's A, 55\% in
              Child's B, 47\% in Child's C cirrhosis, and 26\% in acute liver

              confounders. SETTING: Four hospitals (1 national cardiovascular

              undergoing thoracic aortic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
              between January 2010 and October 2012 (n = 1,047). INTERVENTIONS:
              Outcomes in patients treated with fibrinogen concentrate or
              cryoprecipitate (fibrinogen group) were compared with those who
              did not receive these products (no fibrinogen group) based on

              AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1,047 patients enrolled in this study,
              247 patients received fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate.
              The median amount of administered fibrinogen was 3 g
              (interquartile range 2-4 g). Eighty-seven patients were excluded
              from the propensity-score matching because of missing data.
              Propensity-score-matched analysis showed no significant
              difference in the incidence of thromboembolic events or 30-day
              mortality rate between the groups. Multivariate analysis revealed
              that the fibrinogen group showed no significant difference in
              thromboembolic events (odds ratio 1.22; 95\% confidence interval
              0.76-1.95; p = 0.408) or mortality rate (odds ratio 0.44; 95\%
              confidence interval 0.18-1.12; p = 0.081) compared with those in

              interactions between the affected clone and the bone marrow
              microenvironment drive the pathogenesis and progression of MDS,
              resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis, blast accumulation, and a
              variable predisposition for progression to acute leukemia. For
              early stage, lower-risk patients with MDS, the mainstay of
              therapy is supportive care, especially red blood cell
              transfusions, to alleviate the symptoms of anemia. However, these
              interventions do not target the underlying pathobiology of
              disease and have questionable impact on the natural disease
              course. Dysregulated inflammatory, apoptotic, and angiogenic
              cytokines play major roles in the pathobiology of MDS and
              represent attractive therapeutic targets. Lenalidomide is an
              orally bioavailable analogue of thalidomide with more potent
              immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antitumor activities than
              the parent compound and with a better safety profile. In
              nonclinical studies, the effects of lenalidomide include
              potentiation of clonogenic response to erythropoietin, activation
              of integrin-mediated adhesion, cell cycle arrest, sensitization
              to apoptotic signals, and abrogation of cellular response to
              receptor-initiated trophic signals. These effects have the
              potential to impact survival and apoptosis of erythropoietic
              progenitor cells and their progeny. Data from clinical trials of
              lenalidomide in MDS have shown erythropoietic- and
              cytogenetic-remitting activities that frequently result in
              transfusion independence, particularly in patients with 5q-
              deletion and lower-risk MDS. Decreases in microvessel density in
              bone marrow specimens from responding patients provide supportive
              evidence of an antiangiogenic effect in MDS. Adverse effects,
              most commonly myelosuppression, are generally manageable with
              dose reduction and growth factor support. Multicenter phase II
              and III studies are under way to further assess the erythroid and
              cytogenetic response rates in distinct subtypes of MDS, including
              5q- deletion, and to optimize its clinical application.

  abstract = "HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 63-year-old woman was referred
              to our hospital for evaluation of leukocytopenia and blast cells
              in the peripheral blood smear. The general condition was reduced,
              a maculo-papulous exanthema of the face and upper body as well as
              a general lymphadenopathy were found. INVESTIGATIONS: Bone marrow
              examination revealed the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia
              (AML) FAB M1 and a normal karyotype. Extramedullary
              manifestations of AML were demonstrated in skin and lymphnode
              biopsies. ECG showed no signs of ischemia, echocardiography a
              normal left-ventricular function. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The
              patient received induction treatment using sequential high-dose
              cytosinarabinosid and mitoxantrone, which rapidly resolved the
              extramedullary skin- and lymphnode-manifestations of the AML.
              During the chemotherapy-associated bone marrow aplasia a
              non-ST-elevation infarction (NSTEMI) developed combined with
              severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, high-grade mitral valve
              deficiency and serious congestive heart failure with respiratory
              failure. Coronary artery angiography showed a complete occlusion
              of the proximal ramus circumflexus. Percutanous coronary
              intervention (PCI) with implantation of a bare-metal stent was
              performed, which resulted in prompt improvement of the condition.
              Despite the transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia a dual
              antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel
              was given. After each unit of platelets transfused a loading dose
              of 600 mg clopidogrel was given to prevent stent thrombosis. The
              patient did not experience major bleeding and was discharged in
              complete remission of AML and completely cardially recompensated.
              CONCLUSION: Coronary angiography and stenting can generally be
              safely performed in patients with transfusion-dependent
              thrombocytopenia. Despite a higher risk of bleeding an oral dual
              antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and e. g. clopidogrel according
              to the guidelines should be performed, but its duration should be
              adapted to the individual patient circumstances.",

              that orchestrates a growing spectrum of biologic processes. At
              the endothelial cell surface, A2 and S100A10 (p11) form a
              heterotetramer, which accelerates tissue plasminogen
              activator-dependent activation of the fibrinolytic protease,
              plasmin. In antiphospholipid syndrome, anti-A2 antibodies are
              associated with clinical thrombosis, whereas overexpression of A2
              in acute promyelocytic leukemia promotes hyperfibrinolytic
              bleeding. A2 is upregulated in hypoxia, and mice deficient in A2
              are resistant to oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization,
              suggesting a role for A2 in human retinal vascular proliferation.
              In solid malignancies, the (A2•p11)(2) tetramer may promote
              cancer cell invasion, whereas in multiple myeloma A2 enables
              malignant plasmacyte growth and predicts prognosis. In the
              central nervous system, the p11 enables membrane insertion of
              serotonin receptors that govern mood. In the peripheral nervous
              system, p11 directs sodium channels to the plasma membrane,
              enabling pain perception. In cerebral cortex neurons, A2
              stabilizes the microtubule-associated tau protein, which, when
              mutated, is associated with frontotemporal dementia. In
              inflammatory dendritic cells, A2 maintains late

              inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion in a model of

              hypofibrinogenemia is most often asymptomatic. Thromboembolism
              may occur either spontaneously or in association with fibrinogen
              substitution therapy. Women with afibrinogenemia suffer from
              recurrent pregnancy loss but this can also occur in women with
              hypofibrinogenemia. Dysfibrinogenemia, caused mainly by missense
              mutations, is commonly associated with bleeding, thrombophilia,
              or both; however, most individuals are asymptomatic.
              Hypodysfibrinogenemia is a subcategory of this disorder. Even in
              specialized laboratories, the precise diagnosis of some
              fibrinogen disorders may be difficult. Determination of the
              molecular defects is important because it gives the possibility
              to confirm the diagnosis, to elaborate a diagnostic strategy, to
              distinguish in some cases that the patient is at risk of
              thrombosis rather than bleeding, and to enable prenatal
              diagnosis. However, genotype-phenotype correlations are not easy
              to establish. Replacement therapy is effective in treating
              bleeding episodes, but because the pharmacokinetics of fibrinogen
              after replacement therapy is highly variable among patients, it
              is important to adjust the treatment individually.",

              polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Pathogenesis of
              blood clotting activation in these diseases is multifactorial,

              These include not only elevations in the counts of circulating
              blood cells, arising from the clonal proliferation of
              hematopoietic progenitor cells, but also modifications of several

              stratified in ``high-risk'' or ``low-risk'' thrombotic categories

              fibrinolysis in patients suffering from hematological
              malignancies, beyond acute promyelocytic leukemia. We performed a
              systematic literature search employing the databases Pubmed,

              investigating fibrinolysis in hematological malignancies. Studies
              investigating fibrinolysis in acute promyelocytic leukemia or
              disseminated intravascular coagulation were excluded. We
              identified 32 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. A
              majority of the studies were published more than two decades ago,
              and none of the studies examined all available markers of
              fibrinolysis or used dynamic clot lysis assays. In acute leukemia
              L-asparaginase treatment induced a hypofibrinolytic state, and
              prior to chemotherapy there seemed to be little to no change in
              fibrinolysis. In studies examining fibrinolysis during
              chemotherapy results were ambiguous. Two studies examining
              multiple myeloma indicated hypofibrinolysis prior to
              chemotherapy, and in another plasma cell disease, amyloid light
              chain-amyloidosis, clear signs of hyperfibrinolysis were
              demonstrated. In myeloproliferative neoplasms, the studies
              reported signs of hypofibrinolysis, in line with the increased
              risk of thrombosis in this disease. Only one study regarding
              lymphoma was identified, which indicated no alterations in
              fibrinolysis. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrated
              that only sparse, and mainly old, evidence exists on fibrinolysis
              in hematological malignancy. However, the published studies
              showed a tendency toward hypofibrinolysis in myeloproliferative
              disorders, an increased risk of hyperfibrinolysis, and bleeding
              in patients with AL-amyloidosis, whereas studies regarding acute
              leukemias were inconclusive except with regard to L-asparaginase

              high risk for thrombohemorrhagic complications. Clinical
              complications may range from localized thrombosis to bleeding of
              varying degrees of severity because of disseminated intravascular
              coagulation (DIC). Life-threatening bleeding is frequent in acute
              leukemias, particularly in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
              Laboratory assessments show profound hemostatic imbalance in this
              condition, with activation of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and
              nonspecific proteolysis systems. An important pathogenetic role
              is attributed to the leukemic cell properties interfering with
              the hemostatic mechanisms. However, chemotherapy and intercurrent
              infections also contribute to the bleeding risk in the patient
              with leukemia. In this article, we will attempt to describe what
              is currently known about the coagulopathy of acute leukemia,
              summarize the various aspects of the hemostatic abnormalities
              underlying this disorder, and revise the principal pathogenetic
              mechanisms. We will also try to provide information on the
              current therapeutic tools and recommendations for the management
              of life-threatening bleeding in this disease. Finally, a special

              Genetic studies are beginning to clarify the mechanisms by which
              transcription factors help distinguish MK progenitors from other
              blood cell lineages and subsequently confer unique cellular

              proplatelets. This review focuses on the roles of selected

              on human and murine models of thrombocytopenia that result from
              impaired MK differentiation. The findings we review help

              combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Early mortality
              most often is due to a severe and often catastrophic bleeding,
              often intracerebral in location, and remains a major cause of
              treatment failure. Thrombosis, either at diagnosis or during the
              course of treatment, may be unrecognized and reflects the
              complexity of the coagulopathy. The dual phenomenon of bleeding
              and thrombosis is attributable to at least three processes:
              disseminated intravascular coagulation; fibrinolysis (generated
              in part by expression of annexin-II on the APL cell surface); and
              direct proteolysis of several proteins including fibrinogen and

              with a full characterization of the hemostatic defect. Vitamin K
              deficiency always should be considered and excluded by clinical
              history and laboratory tests. Localized bleeding is treated by
              packing, topical hemostatic agents, dressings, vessel ligation,
              laser beam coagulation, or embolization. Platelet transfusions
              are administered for hemorrhage secondary to severe platelet
              dysfunction or thrombocytopenia, but usually are not indicated if
              there is no bleeding, even though platelets may be as low as
              10,000/microL. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia that is
              refractory to random-donor platelets may respond to cross-matched
              compatible platelets, or to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa).
              Fresh frozen plasma is indicated infrequently; bleeding due to
              coagulopathies is better managed with cryoprecipitate if
              fibrinogen is low, or with clotting factor concentrates
              appropriate for the specific clotting factors found to be
              deficient. rFVIIa or activated prothrombin complex concentrate
              usually controls hemorrhage due to autoantibodies directed
              against factor VIII, and acquired von Willebrand's disease may be
              responsive to desmopressin or intravenous gamma globulin
              infusion. Antifibrinolytic agents often enhance other hemostatic
              therapies, but should be withheld if there is genitourinary
              bleeding or evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
              Finally, plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption to remove

              complication is venous thromboembolism (VTE). Other thrombotic
              conditions occur in association with specific disorders, such as
              thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in hematopoietic stem cell
              transplantation and disseminated intravascular coagulation in
              acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical trials show that
              unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin

              after major surgery or when hospitalized for acute medical

              applicable to patients with hematologic malignancies, in whom

  abstract = "During activation of the fibrinolytic system plasminogen is
              converted to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) or
              urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). t-PA is
              predominantly released from endothelial cells, u-PA primarily by
              renal parenchymal cells. The activation of plasminogen is
              regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), plasmin
              is controlled by alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. The fibrinolytic
              system is not only involved in the intravascular dissolution of
              fibrin (thrombi), it also plays a vital role in normal
              physiologic reproduction, wound repair, angiogenesis, and tissue
              remodeling. Fibrinolysis is also a vital component in the
              pathogenesis of neoplastic disease. It is essential in releasing
              cells from their primary site of origin, providing nutrition for
              neoplastic cell growth and promoting cell mobility and motility.
              In neoplastic cells the degradation of the extracellular matrix
              proteins is facilitated by excessive expression of u-PA, t-PA,
              and u-PAR. In many forms of carcinoma increased expression of
              u-PAR and u-PA is associated with significantly shorter survival.
              Greater expression of u-PA in breast cancer cells, for example,
              is associated with shorter survival and increased relapse rate.
              Progressively aggressive neoplastic cells evidence high
              expression of u-PA and u-PAR activities, variable expression of
              t-PA, and enhanced PAI-1 and PAI-2 activities. In acute
              nonlymphocytic leukemias, poor outcome correlates with high t-PA
              levels. In acute progranulocytic leukemia there is a high
              incidence of DIC. Neoplastic prostatic tissue also expresses high
              u-PA activity and the more aggressive the cell line, the greater
              the number of u-PAR and the higher the u-PA activity. In
              gynecologic malignancies, a greater expression of u-PA in
              combination with cathepsin D is associated with widespread
              disease and poor prognosis. High u-PA values were also seen in
              patients with brain, gastric, and hepatic malignancies. It is
              evident that the plasminogen-plasmin system is a vital component
              in the biology of neoplastic disease and that it is, in theses
              conditions, in no way beneficial to the host.",

              [cylophosphamide]/methotrexate/ASP ([CYC]/MTX/ASP) and high dose
              arabinoside/ASP (HIDAC/ASP). In 33 children with acute

              clinical signs of thrombosis, even though two patients showed
              four altered coagulation parameters on the same day. This shows,

  abstract = "Background. Febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the
              most frequent adverse reactions to platelets. A number of
              observations argue against the widely held view that these
              reactions result from the interaction between antileukocyte
              antibodies in the recipient and leukocytes in the platelet
              product. We sought to determine whether substances in the plasma
              or the cells in the product cause reactions to transfused
              platelets. Methods. We separated standard platelet concentrates
              into their plasma and cellular components and then transfused
              both portions in random order. Patients were monitored for
              reactions during all transfusions. Before each transfusion, the
              concentration of cytokines (interleukin-1$\beta$ and
              interleukin-6) was measured in the platelet products. Studies
              were also performed on the platelet products to determine the
              effect of storage on the concentration of cytokines. Results.
              Sixty-four pairs of platelet-product components (the plasma
              supernatant and the cells) were administered to 12 patients.
              There were 20 reactions to the plasma supernatant and 6 reactions
              to the cells (chi-square = 6.50, P = 0.009). Eight transfusions
              were associated with reactions to both products. The plasma
              component was more likely to cause severe reactions than the
              cells (chi-square = 9.6, P<0.01). A strong positive correlation
              was observed between the reactions and the concentration of
              interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 in the plasma supernatant
              (P<0.001 and P = 0.034, respectively). In vitro studies
              demonstrated that interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6
              concentrations rise progressively in stored platelets and that
              these concentrations are related to the leukocyte count in the
              platelet product. Conclusions. Bioreactive substances in the
              plasma supernatant of the platelet product cause most febrile
              reactions associated with platelet transfusions. Removing the
              plasma supernatant before transfusion can minimize or prevent
              these reactions.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with
              a hemorrhagic disorder of unknown cause that responds to
              treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid. METHODS: We studied a
              newly described receptor for fibrinolytic proteins, annexin II,
              in cells from patients with APL or other leukemias. We examined
              initial rates of in vitro generation of plasmin by tissue
              plasminogen activator (t-PA) in the presence of APL cells that
              did or did not have the characteristic translocation of APL,
              t(15;17). We also determined the effect of all-trans-retinoic
              acid on the expression of annexin II and the generation of
              cell-surface plasmin. RESULTS: The expression of annexin II, as
              detected by a fluorescein-tagged antibody, was greater on
              leukemic cells from patients with APL than on other types of
              leukemic cells (mean fluorescence intensity, 6.9 and 2.9,
              respectively; P<0.01). The t(15;17)-positive APL cells stimulated
              the generation of cell-surface, t-PA-dependent plasmin twice as
              efficiently as the t(15;17)-negative cells. This increase in
              plasmin was blocked by an anti-annexin II antibody and was
              induced by transfection of t(15;17)-negative cells with annexin
              II complementary DNA. The t(15;17)-positive APL cells contained
              abundant messenger RNA for annexin II, which disappeared through
              a transcriptional mechanism after treatment with
              all-trans-retinoic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormally high levels of
              expression of annexin II on APL cells increase the production of
              plasmin, a fibrinolytic protein. Overexpression of annexin II may
              be a mechanism for the hemorrhagic complications of APL.",

              METHODS: A total of 809 patients with essential thrombocythemia
              who were at high risk for vascular events received low-dose
              aspirin plus either anagrelide or hydroxyurea. The composite
              primary end point was the actuarial risk of arterial thrombosis
              (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular
              accident, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial
              thrombosis), venous thrombosis (deep-vein thrombosis,
              splanchnic-vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism), serious
              hemorrhage, or death from thrombotic or hemorrhagic causes.
              RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 39 months, patients in the
              anagrelide group were significantly more likely than those in the
              hydroxyurea group to have reached the primary end point (odds

               stem-cell transplantation or chemotherapy for hematologic
               cancers or solid tumors to receive prophylactic platelet
               transfusions at a low dose, a medium dose, or a high dose
               (1.1x10(11), 2.2x10(11), or 4.4x10(11) platelets per square
               meter of body-surface area, respectively), when morning platelet
               counts were 10,000 per cubic millimeter or lower. Clinical signs
               of bleeding were assessed daily. The primary end point was
               bleeding of grade 2 or higher (as defined on the basis of World
               Health Organization criteria). RESULTS: In the 1272 patients who
               received at least one platelet transfusion, the primary end
               point was observed in 71\%, 69\%, and 70\% of the patients in

               group, respectively (differences were not significant). The
               incidences of higher grades of bleeding, and other adverse
               events, were similar among the three groups. The median number
               of platelets transfused was significantly lower in the low-dose
               group (9.25x10(11)) than in the medium-dose group (11.25x10(11))

               medium, P<0.001 for high vs. low and high vs. medium), but the
               median number of platelet transfusions given was significantly
               higher in the low-dose group (five, vs. three in the medium-dose
               and three in the high-dose group; P<0.001 for low vs. medium and
               low vs. high). Bleeding occurred on 25\% of the study days on
               which morning platelet counts were 5000 per cubic millimeter or
               lower, as compared with 17\% of study days on which platelet
               counts were 6000 to 80,000 per cubic millimeter (P<0.001).
               CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of platelets administered as a
               prophylactic transfusion led to a decreased number of platelets
               transfused per patient but an increased number of transfusions
               given. At doses between 1.1x10(11) and 4.4x10(11) platelets per
               square meter, the number of platelets in the prophylactic
               transfusion had no effect on the incidence of bleeding.

              This trial assessed whether a policy of not giving prophylactic
              platelet transfusions was as effective and safe as a policy of
              providing prophylaxis. METHODS: We conducted this randomized,
              open-label, noninferiority trial at 14 centers in the United
              Kingdom and Australia. Patients were randomly assigned to
              receive, or not to receive, prophylactic platelet transfusions
              when morning platelet counts were less than 10$\times$10(9) per
              liter. Eligible patients were persons 16 years of age or older
              who were receiving chemotherapy or undergoing stem-cell
              transplantation and who had or were expected to have
              thrombocytopenia. The primary end point was bleeding of World
              Health Organization (WHO) grade 2, 3, or 4 up to 30 days after
              randomization. RESULTS: A total of 600 patients (301 in the
              no-prophylaxis group and 299 in the prophylaxis group) underwent
              randomization between 2006 and 2011. Bleeding of WHO grade 2, 3,
              or 4 occurred in 151 of 300 patients (50\%) in the no-prophylaxis
              group, as compared with 128 of 298 (43\%) in the prophylaxis
              group (adjusted difference in proportions, 8.4 percentage points;
              90\% confidence interval, 1.7 to 15.2; P=0.06 for
              noninferiority). Patients in the no-prophylaxis group had more
              days with bleeding and a shorter time to the first bleeding
              episode than did patients in the prophylaxis group. Platelet use
              was markedly reduced in the no-prophylaxis group. A prespecified
              subgroup analysis identified similar rates of bleeding in the two
              study groups among patients undergoing autologous stem-cell
              transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study support
              the need for the continued use of prophylaxis with platelet
              transfusion and show the benefit of such prophylaxis for reducing
              bleeding, as compared with no prophylaxis. A significant number

              METHODS: In this open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly
              assigned patients with cancer who had acute symptomatic or
              incidental venous thromboembolism to receive either
              low-molecular-weight heparin for at least 5 days followed by oral
              edoxaban at a dose of 60 mg once daily (edoxaban group) or
              subcutaneous dalteparin at a dose of 200 IU per kilogram of body
              weight once daily for 1 month followed by dalteparin at a dose of

              group (difference in risk, -3.4 percentage points; 95\% CI, -7.0
              to 0.2). Major bleeding occurred in 36 patients (6.9\%) in the
              edoxaban group and in 21 patients (4.0\%) in the dalteparin group
              (difference in risk, 2.9 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 5.6).
              CONCLUSIONS: Oral edoxaban was noninferior to subcutaneous
              dalteparin with respect to the composite outcome of recurrent
              venous thromboembolism or major bleeding. The rate of recurrent
              venous thromboembolism was lower but the rate of major bleeding
              was higher with edoxaban than with dalteparin. (Funded by Daiichi

              bind to platelets. GPIIb is a two-chain protein containing

              that lacks a typical signal peptide, translocates from the

              expression of protein p11 (S100A10) and tyrosine phosphorylation
              of annexin 2 because annexin 2 release is completely eliminated
              on depletion of p11, inactivation of tyrosine kinase, or mutation
              of tyrosine 23. Translocation of annexin 2 to the cell surface

              plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and
              accelerating the generation of plasmin. In humans, overexpression
              of A2 by acute promyelocytic leukemia cells is associated with
              excessive fibrinolysis and hemorrhage, whereas anti-A2
              autoantibodies appear to accentuate the risk of thrombosis in
              patients with anti-phospholipid syndrome. Complete deficiency of
              A2 in mice leads to a lack of tPA cofactor activity, accumulation
              of intravascular fibrin, and failure to clear arterial thrombi.
              Within the endothelial cell, p11 is required for Src
              kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of A2, which signals
              translocation of both proteins to the cell surface. Here we show
              that p11 is expressed at very low levels in the absence of A2

              unpartnered p11 becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded via a
              proteasome-dependent mechanism. A2 stabilizes intracellular p11
              through direct binding, thus masking an autonomous p11
              polyubiquitination signal that triggers proteasomal degradation.
              This interaction requires both the p11-binding N-terminal domain
              of A2 and the C-terminal domain of p11. This mechanism prevents
              accumulation of free p11 in the endothelial cell and suggests
              that regulation of tPA-dependent cell surface fibrinolytic
              activity is precisely tuned to the intracellular level of p11.",

              objectives of the present study were to explore platelet function
              in thrombocytopenia using a novel index of impedance aggregometry
              adjusted for platelet count and evaluate the association to
              platelet function assessed by flow cytometry. Hirudin

              patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and 17

              patients was evaluated relative to the aggregation of healthy
              volunteers at the same platelet count. In flow cytometry,
              platelet function was described as expression of the platelet
              surface glycoproteins: bound fibrinogen, CD63, and P-selectin.
              Similar platelet counts were obtained in the patient groups (p =

              some authors still fail to identify TF in platelets, especially
              when assessment in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or washed platelets
              is carried out. This study aims to extend the characterization of
              the subset of TF-positive platelets in PRP from healthy subjects
              and to verify how different centrifugation forces, used to
              prepare the PRP, could affect the analysis of TF-positive
              platelets. Data indicate that large-size platelets express
              significantly higher amount of TF compared to small-size cells,
              in terms of both TF protein and TF mRNA. Upon stimulation, large
              platelets readily expose on the cell membrane TF, which is
              functionally active, i.e., able to generate factor Xa (FXa) as
              well as thrombin. By contrast, TF activity in small platelets is
              almost completely quenched by tissue factor pathway inhibitor
              (TFPI), becoming indeed detectable only after treatment with an
              anti-TFPI antibody. Our data highlight that particular attention
              must be paid to the preparation and collection of the PRP since
              such preanalytical variables may influence the platelet recovery

              cytometry, functional activity tests, proteome, or transcriptome

              enhances blast proliferation and constitutive cytokine secretion.
              In the present study the effects of AML blasts on the platelet
              release of soluble mediators are characterized. Normal platelets
              released soluble (s) P-selectin and platelet-derived growth
              factor (PDGF), both when cultured alone and in the presence of
              AML blasts, and for certain patients the presence of AML blasts
              increased the platelet release of these mediators. Addition of
              exogenous interleukin (IL) 10 to platelet-AML blast cultures
              further increased platelet release of PDGF and sP-selectin. For

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired and
              heterogeneous autoimmune-mediated hematological disease typically
              characterized by a low platelet count. Emerging evidence over the
              past several years suggests that platelet biogenesis and ageing
              are regulated, at least in part, by apoptotic mechanisms.
              However, the association between decreased platelets and
              apoptosis in ITP patients is poorly understood. To better
              understand the role of platelet apoptosis in ITP pathophysiology,
              we investigated apoptotic markers in platelets acquired from 40
              chronic ITP patients. Furthermore, the results of ITP patients
              were compared to those from 40 healthy individuals. METHODS:
              Markers of apoptosis, including phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure
              and mitochondrial inner membrane potentials ($\Delta$$\Psi$m),
              were examined using flow cytometry. The expression of
              pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bak and Bax and anti-apoptotic
              molecules such as Bcl-xL were determined using quantitative
              real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. RESULTS: Our study
              demonstrated that the platelet mitochondrial membrane
              depolarization in chronic ITP patients tended to be higher than
              in healthy controls. Additionally, the proportion of platelets
              with surface-exposed PS in chronic ITP was significantly higher
              than that of controls. The results showed that the expression
              levels of Bak and Bax were significantly higher in chronic ITP
              patients than in healthy controls; Bcl-xL expression levels were
              significantly decreased in the platelets of chronic ITP patients
              compared to healthy controls. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: study
              indicates that the enhancement of platelet apoptosis observed in
              patients with chronic ITP may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms
              of chronic ITP.",

              Prior to the treatment, the patients had elevated D-dimer and
              decreased fibrinogen levels. Plasma urokinase-type plasminogen
              activator receptor (uPAR) and plasmin-ɑ2 antiplasmin complexes

              profile may affect the clinical course of ITP is unknown.
              METHODS: In this study, we report our experience in a cohort of
              ITP patients with APA with specific interest to the relevance of
              different antiphospholipid antibody profiles in clinical outcome
              and response to treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-seven out of 159
              patients (23.2\%) fulfilling ITP criteria had a platelet count
              $\leq$50 $\times$ 109/L and tested positive at APA at ITP onset.
              Twenty-three (62.1\%) patients received at least one line of
              treatment for ITP. Fourteen subjects (37.8\%) showing triple
              positivity for APA showed a significantly lower median platelet
              count compared to other APA patients (p = .006). Among these ITP
              subjects with triple positivity, 85.7\% needed a treatment
              because of low platelet count compared to 47.8\% ITP patients
              with non-triple-positive APA (p = .0094). ITP/APA subjects who
              received immunosuppressors had a higher rate of thrombosis (p =
              .024) as well as thrombosis developed in subjects who were on
              steroid therapy at a significantly higher dosage than subjects

              catheterisations, performed in oncohematologic patients between
              April 2003 and December 2004, were prospectively collected. At
              insertion thrombocytopenia was present in 109 cases (28.1\%) and
              neutropenia in 67 (17.3\%). Hemorrhage after CVC insertion
              occurred in five thrombocytopenic patients (1.3\%). The median
              duration of catheterisation was 18.8 days (range 1-89), longer in
              the 7-French CVCs utilised in leukemic patients (24.3 days) and
              shorter in 12-French CVCs (11 days), used for PBSC harvesting.
              Deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 13 cases (3.3\%).
              Ninety-two catheterisations (12.6/1000 days-catheter) were
              complicated by infections: 19 local infections (4.8\%) and 73
              (18.8\%) bacteraemias of which 45 (11.6\%) were catheter-related,
              mainly due to Gram positive germs (32/45, 71.1\%). The frequency
              of catheter-related bacteraemia was 7.2 events/1000
              days-catheter. Thirteen CVCs were removed due to thrombosis, 15
              due to infections, 20 due to malfunction, the remaining 333 at

              AML and high-dose chemotherapy as risk factors. Even though
              hematological in-patients are at increased risk for bleeding and

  abstract = "Background: Thirty-seven consecutive individuals in CR of AMI
              received intensified conditioning and autologous stem-cell
              transplantation. Methods: For those receiving PBSC (n = 28),
              mobilization protocol was with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg followed
              by G-CSF injection at 5-10 $\mu$g/kg; stem cells were harvested
              by large volume apheresis (6-8 blood volumes) and then
              cryopreserved. Ablative therapy consisted of fractionated TBI
              (total 12 Gy), followed by four fractions (1.5 Gy each) of total
              nodal irradiation (TNI), and CY 120 mg/kg under mesna cover.
              Results: For individuals transplanted in CR 1 (n = 31) the median
              time from diagnosis to grafting was 167 (range 92-212) days.
              Patients transplanted with PBSC received higher number of CFU-GM
              $\times$ 104/kg (P < 0.01), a difference that was associated with
              a significantly shorter platelet recovery. While there was no
              early transplant-associated mortality, in 10 patients death was
              caused by recurrence of the disease. The median survival is 1746
              (range 105-4467) days and 26 (70\%) survive disease free, at a
              median 2207 (range 698-4467) days from transplantation.
              Multivariate analysis showed that survival of patients with
              AML-M3, receiving higher CFU-GM (P = 0.04) and without
              morphological dysplasia (P = 0.01) was longest. Discussion: For
              patients in remission of AML, transplantation with PBPC appears
              to be an effective form of intensification, particularly when TBI
              + TNI (delivering a total of 18 Gy to the axial skeleton) were

              post-HSCT hepatic VOD/SOS and defibrotide, including its
              pharmacological, clinical, and regulatory profile. In children
              and adults following HSCT, defibrotide is approved for the
              treatment of hepatic VOD/SOS with concomitant renal or pulmonary
              dysfunction in the United States and for the treatment of severe
              hepatic VOD/SOS in the European Union. Day +100 survival rates

              multiple mechanisms to restore thrombo-fibrinolytic balance and
              protect endothelial cells, and there are promising data on the
              use of defibrotide for VOD/SOS prophylaxis in high-risk children

              after HSCT in the European Union and hepatic VOD/SOS with renal
              or pulmonary dysfunction in the United States. Its efficacy in
              patients with VOD/SOS with MOD post-HSCT was demonstrated in a
              clinical-trial program that included a historically controlled
              treatment study, a phase 2 trial, and a large T-IND
              expanded-access program that also included patients without MOD
              and who received chemotherapy without HSCT. Expert commentary:
              Defibrotide appears to protect endothelial cells and restore the
              thrombolytic-fibrinolytic balance. It addresses a significant
              clinical need and has demonstrated favorable Day +100 survival
              and overall adverse-event rates that seem similar to control
              groups receiving supportive care alone. Currently, defibrotide is
              under investigation for the prevention of VOD/SOS in high-risk
              pediatric and adult patients.",

              characterized by low platelet count and presence of IgG
              autoantibodies to platelet surface glycoproteins, such as
              $\alpha$ IIb$\beta$3 and GPIb/IX. Our previous work has shown
              that platelets in ITP patients exist in an activated state. Two
              different marker-based approaches are used to study the course of
              platelet activation: (1) binding of PAC-1 antibody, signifying a
              change in $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 conformation, and (2) expression of
              P-selectin, signifying alpha granule content release from
              platelets. Here, we describe the development of a new scFv
              antibody (R38) that, compared with PAC-1, appears to better
              distinguish between platelets of ITP patients and healthy
              controls. Notably, R38 was generated using commercially sourced
              resting-state integrin that was coated on a microtiter plate. Its
              ability to distinguish between ITP patients and healthy controls
              thus suggests that inadvertent integrin activation caused by
              coating involves a conformational change and exposure of a
              cryptic epitope. This report also describes for the first time
              the potential use of an scFv antibody in the immunodiagnosis of

              amounts of the arsenic azoprotein, for example, often bled to
              death from injuries that proved trivial in control animals, and

              no part in the outcome. So, too, the addition of minute amounts
              of 4-arsonophenylazoprotein to plasma procured from citrated
              rabbit or human blood greatly prolonged the time required for
              clotting after recalcification. Other arsenic-containing
              compounds,-for example, those in which arsenic See PDF for

              linkage,-were largely devoid of anticoagulant and antilymphoma
              effects. The findings as a whole show clearly that the structural
              requirements for anticoagulant and antilymphoma effects are: (a)
              possession of negatively charged arsonic or arsinoso groups, (b)
              large molecular size (protein), and (c) linkage of

              4-carboxyphenylazoprotein and 4-sulfonophenylazoprotein,-were

              prognosis can be improved by allogeneic stem cell
              transplantation. The use of autologous stem cell transplantation
              is now investigated as an alternative to allotransplantation due
              to its lower risk of serious complications. However,
              autotransplantation is associated with a relatively high risk of
              post-transplant AML relapse that can be derived from
              contaminating leukemia cells in the autograft. Peripheral blood
              mobilized stem cell (PBSC) grafts usually contain a higher number
              of platelets. The degree of platelet contamination is determined
              by the peripheral blood platelet count at the time of harvesting,
              and the platelets become activated and release soluble mediators
              during the ex vivo handling of PBSC grafts. Many of these
              platelet-derived mediators can bind to specific receptors
              expressed by AML blasts, and the platelet contamination may then
              alter AML blast survival and thereby influence the risk of
              post-transplant leukemia relapse. Therefore, we conclude that the
              platelet contamination of autologous stem cell grafts is possibly
              of clinical importance, but the effect of this nonstandardized
              parameter is difficult to predict in individual patients because
              the number of graft-contaminating platelets, the degree of
              platelet activation, and the effects of platelet-derived
              mediators on AML blasts differ between patients.",

              However, the prognostic factors for ICH in AML patients are still
              under investigation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 841 AML
              patients admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine from
              January 1995 to December 2007 were enrolled in this study.
              RESULTS: There were 51 patients with ICH, median age of 51 (range
              17-86), including 12 patients diagnosed as acute promyelocytic
              leukemia. Forty-three patients were refractory/relapsed status.
              ICH was localized in the supratentorium (44 cases), basal
              ganglion (9), cerebellum (5), and brainstem (4). Twenty-one
              patients had multiple sites. Thirty-eight patients had
              intraparenchymal hemorrhage, 16 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 10
              subdural hemorrhage, and one epidural hemorrhage (EDH).
              Hemorrhage ruptured into the ventricles in 13 patients.
              Thirty-four patients (67\%) died of ICH within 30 days of
              diagnosis. Multivariate analysis revealed four independent
              prognostic factors, prolonged prothrombin time international
              normalized ratio >1.5 (P < 0.001), brainstem hemorrhage (P =
              0.001), SAH (P = 0.017), and EDH (P = 0.014). Other
              clinico-laboratory data had no impact on 30-day survival.
              CONCLUSIONS: ICH has high morbidity and mortality in AML. Early

              which was reversed by JTE-013, a specific antagonist of G
              protein-coupled Sph-1-P receptor S1P2; S1P2 was confirmed to be
              expressed in these cells. A similar anti-motility effect of
              Sph-1-P was observed in a phagokinetic assay. Consistent with
              these results, treatment of RBL-2H3 cells with Sph-1-P resulted
              in a rounded cell morphology, which was blocked by JTE-013. Under
              the present conditions, Sph-1-P failed to induce intracellular

              antithrombin III (AT III) and heparin cofactor II (HC II), likely
              reflect both intravascular and extravascular coagulation. Several
              studies have reported increased in vivo coagulation in cancer.
              Whether the increased thrombin production in malignancy is
              accompanied by a corresponding increase in thrombin inhibition is
              unknown. This study quantified prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 +
              2), thrombin-AT III (TAT), thrombin-AT III-vitronectin (TAT.V),
              and thrombin-HC II-vitronectin (THCII.V) in the plasmas of
              healthy volunteers (n = 37); patients with localized solid
              tumours before treatment was initiated (n = 39); and five
              patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, both before and during
              weekly chemotherapy. Two of the five non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
              patients developed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) during
              chemotherapy. In normal plasma, where the concentrations of the
              four parameters likely reflect haemostasis, the sum of TAT, TAT.V
              and THCII.V was 61\% that of F1 + 2, compared with 30\% in cancer
              plasmas. In addition, the mean +/- SEM of F1 + 2 in the plasmas
              of cancer patients (1.56 +/- 0.09 nM) was significantly elevated
              (P < 0.001) when compared with healthy volunteers (0.89 +/- 0.06

              approximately 1.5- and 2.9-fold, respectively. Thus, increased
              prothrombin activation in cancer patients, without corresponding
              increases in concentrations of thrombin-inhibitor complexes,
              raise the possibility that a significant portion of the thrombin

              the high risk of DVT in malignancy.",

              with factor VII/activated factor VII to initiate blood
              coagulation. TF may be expressed on the surface of various cells
              including monocytes and endothelial cells. Over-expression of TF
              in human tumor cell lines promotes metastasis. We recently showed
              that hemoglobin (Hb) forms a specific complex with TF purified
              from human malignant melanoma cells and enhances its procoagulant
              activity (PCA). To further study this interaction, we examined
              the effect of Hb on the expression of TF on human malignant (TF+)
              cells and KG1 myeloid leukemia (TF-) cells. Human melanoma A375
              and J82 bladder carcinoma cells, which express TF at moderate and
              relatively high levels, respectively, were incubated with varying
              concentrations (0-1.5 mg/ml) of Hb. After washing, cells were
              analyzed for Hb binding and TF expression using flow cytometry
              and confocal microscopy. Hb bound to the cells in a
              concentration-dependent manner, and increased both TF expression
              and PCA. The human A375 malignant melanoma cells incubated with
              Hb (1 mg/ml) expressed up to six times more TF antigen than cells
              without Hb. This increase in TF expression and PCA of intact
              cells incubated with Hb was significantly inhibited by
              cycloheximide at a concentration of 10 microg/ml (P < 0.01). An
              increase in total cellular TF antigen content was demonstrated by
              specific immunoassay. In contrast, Hb (5 mg/ml) did not induce TF
              expression and PCA on KG1 cells as determined by flow cytometry
              and TF (FXAA) activity. We conclude that Hb specifically binds to
              TF-bearing malignant cells and increases their PCA. This effect
              seems to be at least partly due to de novo synthesis of TF and
              increased surface expression. However, the exact mechanism by
              which Hb binds and upregulates TF expression remains to be
              determined.",

              thromboplastin (3.75 U/kg) or lipopolysaccharide (30 mg/kg). The

              family secreted by activated monocytes, and is expressed in
              atherosclerotic plaque. Smooth muscle cells (SMC), by expressing
              tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) can
              contribute to the thrombogenicity of atherosclerotic plaque.
              Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects
              of OSM on the procoagulant activity of SMC. We observed that OSM
              induced in a concentration-dependent manner a potent procoagulant
              activity (PCA) that was related in part to an increased synthesis
              of TF, both at the cell membrane and in SMC lysates. The
              increased expression of TF on SMC membrane induced by OSM was
              sustained and was still observed 24 h after stimulation by OSM.
              IL-6 and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), two OSM-related
              cytokines, did not significantly modify TF expression at the
              surface of SMC. In addition to its effects on TF, OSM decreased
              the secretion of TFPI in the supernatants of SMC, as well as in
              the lysates, but was devoid of effect on TFPI bound at the
              membrane of SMC. IL-6 and LIF reduced also TFPI secretion, which
              could explain why the PCA of SMC lysates treated by IL-6 or LIF
              was increased, despite an absence of effect on TF expression. In
              conclusion, these data support the hypothesis that by increasing
              the PCA of SMC, OSM might be involved in the thrombotic
              complications associated with plaque rupture.",

              angiogenesis and tumor invasion. Vascular endothelial growth
              factor (VEGF) has been shown to up-regulate the expression of
              MMP-9 in vascular smooth muscle cells. We recently reported that
              hemoglobin (Hb) enhances the expression of tissue factor (TF) and
              VEGF on TF-positive human malignant cells. Therefore, to explore
              the relationship between tumor cell angiogenic protein VEGF and
              MMP-9, we studied the effect of Hb on MMP-9 production in human
              A375 malignant melanoma and J82 bladder carcinoma (TF+) cells and
              in KG1 myeloid leukemia (TF-) cells. Malignant cells were
              incubated with varying concentrations (0-1.0 mg/ml) of Hb and
              analyzed for released MMP-9 by gelatin zymography, dot
              immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western
              blotting. Hb (0.50 mg/ml) induced an almost two-fold increase of
              MMP-9 in both A375 malignant melanoma (398 +/- 62 versus 233 +/-
              61.0 ng/ml, P = 0.027) and J82 bladder carcinoma cells (1.55 +/-
              0.12 versus 0.80 +/- 0.004 ng/ml, P = 0.004), compared with cells
              incubated without Hb. This release of MMP-9 was significantly
              inhibited by cycloheximide (95\%) and by the specific inhibitors
              of protein tyrosine kinase, genistein (70 +/- 3.0\%, P = 0.00027

              (2.0 mg/ml) did not increase MMP-9 in KG1 cells. We conclude that
              Hb-induced synthesis of active MMP-9 in TF-bearing malignant
              cells is due to de novo synthesis of newly formed protein and is
              mediated by protein tyrosine kinase and by mitogen-activated

              leukemia virus (MuLV) were used to transfer human tPA cDNA to
              BBEC. The tPA activity, tPA antigen and tPA inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)
              antigen were determined in the supernatant of transduced
              (BBEC/tPA) cell cultures by an immunoassay. RESULTS: The tPA
              antigen and enzymatic activity in cell culture supernatants of
              BBEC/tPA transduced cells were 75 ng/ml and 14 IU/ml after 4

              leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M
              (OSM)--cytokines that are implicated in acute phase reactions
              during inflammation and which bind to the same cell surface
              receptor unit (glycoprotein gp 130). LIF was also given to mice
              in vivo. Contents of coagulation and fibrinolytic system proteins
              in cell culture supernatants and in mouse liver were determined.
              RESULTS: LIF increased the accumulation of urokinase plasminogen
              activator (u-PA) in the Hep G2 cell culture supernatants
              determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (0.21 +/-
              0.03 (SE) ng/ml at baseline; 0.40 +/- 0.05 ng/ml at 100 U/ml, P <
              0.05; 0.57 +/- 0.06 ng/ml at 500 U/ml, P < 0.01; n = 9) without
              altering total protein content. OSM elicited a similar effect
              (0.25 +/- 0.04 ng/ml at baseline, 0.62 +/- 0.19 ng/ml at 1 ng/ml;
              P < 0.05, n = 6). A monoclonal antibody against gp 130 abrogated
              the response to both agents (n = 9). Plasminogen activator
              inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) (assayed by ELISA, n = 9), the PAI-1
              binding protein, vitronectin (immunoprecipitation, n = 3) and
              tissue factor (ELISA, n = 3) were not affected by LIF, but
              fibrinogen production increased up to twofold with LIF (500 U/ml;
              Western blot, n= 3). In HUVECs, synthesis of tissue type
              plasminogen activator or PAI-1 was not altered by LIF or OSM
              (ELISA, n = 9). In vivo, intraperitoneal recombinant murine LIF
              (2 mu g) increased liver concentrations of u-PA by 30\% and
              fibrinogen by 220\% in mice. CONCLUSIONS: LIF and OSM produced by
              immune cells may modify fibrinolysis and coagulation by altering
              expression of u-PA and fibrinogen, thereby contributing to
              coagulopathy.",

  author   = "Saxon, B R and Blanchette, V S and Butchart, S and Lim-Yin, J and
              Poon, A O",
  abstract = "PURPOSE: Bone marrow aspiration is often performed to diagnose
              childhood acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) because no
              non-invasive investigation to confirm the diagnosis is routinely
              available. Reticulated platelets (RPs--young platelets
              characterized by a high RNA content--increase with increased
              platelet production and may be useful in the diagnosis of ITP.
              METHODS: To assess the role of RP counts in distinguishing ITP,
              we compared counts from 15 consecutive patients with ITP with
              counts from 20 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
              10 with aplasia, and 27 healthy normal children. Whole blood in
              edetic acid (EDTA) was labelled with a platelet-specific
              monoclonal antibody and incubated with thiazole orange (TO). A
              standard gate was set to achieve a fluorescence value of 1.3 +/-
              0.5\% for control lyophilized platelets. RESULTS: Patients with
              ITP had a mean (+/- 1 standard deviation) RP level of 32.9 +/-
              10.2\%; patients with ALL, 6.6 +/- 3.1\%; patients with aplasia,
              3.4 +/- 2.0\%; and normal patients, 7.9 +/- 2.9\%. The difference
              in RPs between the ITP group and the ALL, aplasia, and normal
              groups was highly significant (p < 0.0001 each), with no
              significant difference between the non-ITP groups (p = 0.12).
              CONCLUSIONS: Measuring RPs by this simple whole-blood cytometric
              technique discriminated very well between the acute ITP and
              non-ITP groups. This test has a strong positive predictive value
              and may prove very useful in the assessment of childhood acute

  author   = "{Acharya S.} and {Bussel J.B.}",
  abstract = "Purpose: Sodium valproate is a commonly used anticonvulsant in
              the management of childhood refractory epilepsy with good
              response rates and acceptable toxicity. Hepatotoxicity is the
              most widely recognized toxicity. With the use of higher drug
              levels to achieve adequate seizure control, hematologic toxicity
              is being increasingly encountered, and the pediatric hematologist
              is consulted for these problems in the pre- or perioperative
              setting. The purpose of this article is to characterize the
              various hematologic toxicities encountered in a clinical setting
              and to provide guidelines to assist in the management of these
              patients. Methods: A literature review was undertaken to identify
              the hematologic toxicities of valproate used as monotherapy or
              polytherapy. Key words used in the search were valproate,
              hematology, and bleeding. Results: Valproate can cause direct
              bone marrow suppression leading to aplastic anemia or peripheral
              cytopenia affecting one or more cell lines. Occasional fatal bone
              marrow failure, myelodysplasia, and a clinical picture resembling
              acute promyelocytic leukemia have also been seen.
              Thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis, neutropenia, and pure red cell
              aplasia can occur but are not reported to be life-threatening. A
              bleeding diathesis associated with valproate use may include
              thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function, and acquired von
              Willebrand disease type I. Conclusions: Hematologic toxicities of
              valproate are common, vary in onset and severity, are recurrent,
              transient, or persistent, and usually occur with a serum
              valproate level greater than 100 $\mu$g/mL. In most situations,
              even when highly clinically significant, they can be reversed
              with dosage reduction; drug discontinuation is rarely required.
              Potential adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia and leukopenia
              are easily detected by laboratory monitoring, which should be
              continued indefinitely at least on a quarterly basis. Caution for
              elective surgery is advised; preoperative coagulation studies
              should be done, including platelet function studies and von
              Willebrand factor levels. Perioperative use of DDAVP to increase
              von Willebrand factor levels and improve platelet function is
              appropriate in some cases.",

              (HSCT). The fibrinolytic response to ongoing hemostatic
              activation in HSCT remains to be elucidated. Global fibrinolytic
              capacity (GFC) is a novel method, which reflects the amount of
              generated D-dimer when fibrinolysis of a freeze-dried fibrin clot
              is stopped by introducing aprotinin. GFC is sensitive to all the
              factors involved in the process of fibrinolysis. The aim of this
              study was to serially assess GFC at certain critical time points
              (days -1, +7, +14, +21 prior to and following stem cell infusion)
              during the course of HSCT. The study group comprised 16 patients
              with hematological malignancies (11 women, five men; median age

              malignancy in adults is well known. Children are now surviving
              malignancies that previously resulted in mortality.
              Complications, however, occur including thrombosis that result in
              mortality and morbidity. This review will explore the association
              in children and discuss the epidemiology and evidence-based
              diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis in this cohort. RECENT
              FINDINGS: Thrombin is an important link between malignancy,
              metastases, and inflammation. The accurate diagnosis of
              thrombosis in the upper venous system is directly related to the
              diagnostic technique used. Antithrombotic treatment is
              challenging owing to higher risks of bleeding, for example,
              decreased platelet counts, tiffelitis, large vascular tumor, etc.
              SUMMARY: Thrombosis and malignancy are associated in children.
              Properly designed studies are urgently required to further define

              Understanding wound healing today involves much more than simply
              stating that there are three phases: inflammation, proliferation,
              and maturation. Wound healing is a complex series of reactions
              and interactions among cells and ``mediators.'' Each year, new
              mediators are discovered and our understanding of inflammatory
              mediators and cellular interactions grows. This article will
              attempt to provide a concise overview on wound healing and wound
              management. Copyright \copyright{}2006 by the American Society of

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To date, no study has systematically investigated the
              impact of drowning-induced asphyxia on hemostasis. Our objective
              was to test the hypothesis that asphyxia induces bleeding by
              hyperfibrinolytic disseminated intravascular coagulation. DESIGN:
              Observational study. SETTING: A 2,100-bed tertiary care facility
              in Vienna, Austria, Europe. PATIENTS: All cases of
              drowning-induced asphyxia (n=49) were compared with other
              patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n=116) and to
              patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (n=83). Six drowning
              victims were investigated prospectively. To study the mechanism,
              a forearm-ischemia model was used in 20 volunteers to investigate
              whether hypoxia releases tissue plasminogen activator.
              INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighty
              percent of patients with drowning-induced asphyxia developed
              overt disseminated intravascular coagulation within 24 hours.
              When compared with nondrowning cardiac arrest patients, drowning
              patients had a 13 times higher prevalence of overt disseminated
              intravascular coagulation at admission (55\% vs 4\%; p<0.001).
              Despite comparable disseminated intravascular coagulation scores,
              acute promyelocytic leukemia patients had higher fibrinogen but
              lower d-dimer levels and platelet counts than drowning patients
              (p<0.001). Drowning victims had a three-fold longer activated
              partial thromboplastin time (124 s; p<0.001) than both
              nondrowning cardiac arrest and acute promyelocytic leukemia
              patients. Hyperfibrinolysis was reflected by up to 1,000-fold
              increased d-dimer levels, greater than 5-fold elevated plasmin
              antiplasmin levels, and a complete absence of thrombelastometric
              clotting patterns, which was reversed by antifibrinolytics and
              heparinase. Thirty minutes of forearm-ischemia increased tissue
              plasminogen activator 31-fold (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The vast
              majority of drowning patients develops overt hyperfibrinolytic
              disseminated intravascular coagulation, partly caused by hypoxia
              induced tissue plasminogen activator release. Antifibrinolytics
              and heparinase partially reverse the abnormal clotting patterns.
              Severe activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation may be
              a marker of combined hyperfibrinolytic afibrinogenemia and
              autoheparinization in drowning-related asphyxia.",

  abstract = "Purpose of Review: This review summarizes the current knowledge
              of the epidemiology, prophylaxis, and treatment of venous
              thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma
              or acute leukemia. Recent Findings: Hematologic malignancies are
              associated with a high risk of thrombotic complications. The
              incidence of these events is greatly variable and is influenced
              by many factors, including the type and the stage of disease,
              antitumor therapies, and the use of central venous device (CVD).
              Epidemiological data allow an estimate of the incidence of VTE in
              acute leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. The effect of
              chemotherapy on the incidence of thrombosis is particularly
              evident in acute leukemia as it causes the exacerbation of the
              clotting/bleeding syndrome typical of this disease. The role of
              chemotherapy is also relevant in lymphoma, and in multiple
              myeloma, in which the use of immunomodulating agents, in
              combination with chemotherapy and steroids significantly
              increases the risk of VTE. Summary: Thrombotic complications have
              a significant impact on morbidity and mortality of hematological
              cancer patients, therefore, in this setting, the issue of
              thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE is important. However, no clear
              recommendation in these conditions is available, with the
              exception of multiple myeloma. Large prospective randomized
              clinical trials are needed to establish the best practice for
              prevention and treatment of VTE in these types of malignant
              diseases. \copyright{} 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism is a common complication after
              hip fractures. However, there are no reliable laboratory assays
              to identify patients at risk for venous thromboembolic (VTE)
              events after major orthopaedic surgery. QUESTION/PURPOSES: (1)
              Are rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) findings associated
              with the presence or development of symptomatic VTE after hip
              fracture surgery? (2) Were any other patient factors associated
              with the presence or development of symptomatic VTE after hip
              fracture surgery? (3) Which ROTEM parameters were the most
              accurate in terms of detecting the association of
              hypercoagulability with symptomatic VTE? METHODS: This
              retrospective study was conducted over a 13-month period. In all,
              354 patients with femoral neck and peritrochanteric fractures who
              underwent hip hemiarthoplasty or cephallomedullary nailing were
              assessed for eligibility. Of those, 99\% (349 of 354) were
              considered eligible for the study, 1\% (3 of 354) of patients
              were excluded due to coagulation disorders, and another 1\% (2 of
              354) were excluded because they died before the postoperative
              ROTEM analysis. An additional 4\% (13 of 354) of patients were
              lost before the minimum study follow-up of 3 months, leaving 95\%
              (336 of 354) for analysis. A ROTEM analysis was performed in all
              patients at the time of their hospital admission, within hours of
              the injury, and on the second postoperative day. The patients
              were monitored for the development of symptoms indicative of VTE,
              and the gold standard tests for diagnosing VTE, such as CT
              pulmonary angiography or vascular ultrasound, were selectively
              performed only in symptomatic patients and not routinely in all
              patients. Therefore, this study evaluates the association of
              ROTEM with only clinically evident VTE events and not with all
              VTE events. ROTEM results did not affect the clinical
              surveillance of the study group and the decision for further work
              up. To determine whether ROTEM findings were associated with the
              presence or development of symptomatic VTE, ROTEM parameters were
              compared between patients with and without symptomatic VTE. To
              establish whether any other patient factors were associated with
              the presence or development of symptomatic VTE after hip fracture
              surgery, clinical parameters and conventional laboratory values
              were also compared between patients with and without symptomatic
              VTE. Finally, to determine which ROTEM parameters were the most
              accurate in terms of detecting the association of
              hypercoagulability with symptomatic VTE, the area under the curve
              (AUC) for certain cut off values of ROTEM parameters was
              calculated. RESULTS: We found several abnormal ROTEM values to be
              associated with the presence or development of symptomatic VTE.
              The preoperative maximum clot firmness was higher in patients
              with clinically evident VTE than in patients without these
              complications (median [interquartile range] 70 mm [68 to 71]
              versus 65 mm [61 to 68]; p < 0.001). The preoperative clot
              formation time was lower in patients with clinically evident VTE
              than those without clinically evident VTE (median 61 seconds [58
              to 65] versus 70 seconds [67 to 74]; p < 0.001), and also the
              postoperative clot formation time was lower in patients with
              clinically evident VTE than those without these complications
              (median 52 seconds [49 to 59] versus 62 seconds [57 to 68]; p <
              0.001). Increased BMI was also associated with clinically evident
              VTE (odds ratio 1.26 [95\% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.53]; p <
              0.001). We found no differences between patients with and without
              clinically evident VTE in terms of age, sex, smoking status,
              comorbidities, and preoperative use of anticoagulants. Lastly,
              preoperative clot formation time demonstrated the best
              performance for detecting the association of hypercoagulability
              with symptomatic VTE (AUC 0.89 [95\% CI 0.81 to 0.97]), with 81\%
              (95\% CI 48\% to 97\%) sensitivity and 86\% (95\% CI 81\% to
              89\%) specificity for clot formation time $\leq$ 65 seconds.
              CONCLUSION: ROTEM's performance in this preliminary study was
              promising in terms of its association with symptomatic VTE. This
              study extended our earlier work by demonstrating that ROTEM has a
              high accuracy in detecting the level of hypercoagulability that
              is associated with symptomatic VTE. However, until its
              performance is validated in a study that applies a diagnostic
              gold standard (such as venography, duplex/Doppler, or chest CT)
              in all patients having ROTEM to confirm its performance, ROTEM
              should not be used as a regular part of clinical practice. LEVEL

              they share the same serine protease family ancestry and changes

              the prevalence and risk factors of TEEs in pediatric solid
              tumors; this included a retrospective analysis of children with
              central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors with and
              without TEEs. TEEs were observed in 7.16\% of analyzed tumors,
              higher in the non-CNS (10.6\%) than in the CNS tumor category
              (1.9\% P <0.0066). Factors associated with significant risk of
              TEEs are as follows: presence of a mediastinal mass (P = 0.0005),
              metastatic disease (P = 0.0086), infection (0.0120), central
              venous access device (CVAD) (P = 0.0167), and steroids as
              chemotherapy (P = 0.01). In patients with CVADs, a mediastinal
              mass (P = 0.0024) and the type of CVAD (peripherally inserted
              central catheters were more significant risk factors compared
              with Mediport; P < 0.0001) were significant risk factors. There
              was a 3.5-fold increased risk of TEEs in patients with CVADs with

              volunteers who were age and sex-matched. The following parameters
              were determined: concentration of tissue plasminogen activator
              antigen (t-PA:Ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 antigen
              concentration (PAI-1:Ag), D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin
              complexes, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time and

              increased t-PA:Ag, PAI-1:Ag and D-dimer levels in patients with
              MPNs. Moreover, we found increased concentrations of
              thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrinogen, as well as
              elevated platelet counts. Detailed analysis revealed that t-PA:Ag

              D-dimer indicate secondary activation of the fibrinolytic system
              in patients with MPNs. Elevated levels of PAI-1 in MPN patients

              antithrombin III (ATIII), protein C, protein S, and D-dimer in 60

              and the development of thrombotic complications, as well as
              therapy was assessed to identify patients at risk of
              thromboembolism. ATIII, protein C, and protein S were
              significantly reduced (P < 0.001) with elevated D-dimer (P <
              0.001) in patients with ALL compared with those in the control
              group. The incidence of thrombotic complications was 16.7\%.
              Patients with thrombotic complications had significantly lower
              ATIII, protein C, protein S, and platelet count, whereas age,
              total leukocyte count, and D-dimer were increased compared with
              those without thrombosis (P < 0.05). Patients under chemotherapy

              hypercoagulability, which may be attributed to hemostatic
              derangement because of increased thrombin generation indicated by
              elevated D-dimer in association with decreased natural

              logical blood clotting system to prevent blood loss in vascular
              injury. However, the notion that deadly thrombosis occurs as a
              result of normal hemostasis in intravascular injury could
              encounter with conceptual skepticism because the term
              'thrombosis' automatically conjures up as serious disease.
              According to 'two-path unifying theory', normal hemostasis is
              initiated only by vascular injury through activated unusually
              large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) path and/or activated tissue
              factor (TF) path. When these two equally important paths are
              unified in normal hemostasis, clotting at external bodily injury
              site is initiated for wound healing, but in intravascular injury
              'blood clots' is formed to produce a disease called 'thrombosis'.
              As microthrombi from ULVWF path and fibrin clots from TF path
              become unified, macrothrombus would be formed via thrombogenesis.
              However, if ULVWF path and TF path cannot be unified due to lone
              ULVWF path activation, partial hemostasis produces only
              microthrombi seen in endotheliopathy-associated vascular
              microthrombotic disease. In real life, in-vivo fibrin clot cannot
              be formed alone via normal hemostasis because bleeding vascular
              injury always activates both ULVWF and TF paths. Without vascular
              injury, microthrombi due to activated ULVWF path occur in
              ADAMTS13 deficiency in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and
              fibrin clots due to activated TF path occur in acute
              promyelocytic leukemia. These two conditions can be called
              pathologic hemostasis. Three thrombogenic pathways produce three
              thrombotic disorders, which include macrothrombosis,
              microthrombosis and true DIC through macrothrombogenesis,

              using flow cytometry. RESULTS: At initial diagnosis, platelet,
              endothelial-derived, and tissue factor-positive microparticle
              levels were significantly high in children with ALL. They
              increased significantly after prednisone and L-asparaginase
              administration. Apoptotic microparticle levels were not elevated
              at diagnosis, but remained high during all induction therapy
              period. None of the patients had evidence of thromboembolism
              during induction therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that
              children with ALL have increased levels of apoptotic,
              platelet-derived, endothelial-derived, and tissue factor-positive
              microprticles during induction therapy. Further studies are
              needed in larger groups of patients in order to evaluate the risk
              of elevated microprticles for development of thromboembolism
              during induction therapy period in children with ALL.",

              dogs by a Carat TX4 optical aggregometer (Entec GmbH, Ilmenau,
              Germany) first used in veterinary practice. The dogs were divided

              with normal haemostasis profile (n = 44), and dogs suffering from

              relapse and toxicity risks. Methotrexate is a key drug in acute
              lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment; it inhibits DNA
              replication by blocking the conversion of 5,10 methylene
              tetrahydrofolate to 5-methylene tetrahydrofolate by methylene
              tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR is central to folate
              metabolism and has two common functional polymorphisms (C677>T
              and A1298>C). The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of
              MTHFR polymorphisms C677>T and A1298>C in Egyptian children with
              ALL and the relation to the frequency of drug-induced
              complications and relapse rate. Forty ALL patients were included
              in the study. They were treated according to modified ALL-BFM 90
              protocol, and were followed up for 3.1-6.5 years. The severity
              and duration of hepatic, mucosal and infectious complications
              during therapy were reported. MTHFR genotyping was done with a
              PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The
              MTHFR C677>T polymorphic allele frequencies were 40, 27.5, and
              32.5\% for TT, CT, and CC genotypes, respectively among the
              studied ALL patients. The MTHFR A1298>C polymorphic allele
              frequencies were 40, 35, and 25\% for AA, AC, and CC genotypes,
              respectively. Methotrexate therapy was significantly associated
              with increased grade III/IV toxicity in TT genotype: diarrhea in
              81.3\%, oral mucositis in 81.3\%, elevated transaminases in
              87.5\%, neutropenia in 78.7\% compared to values of 7.7, 7.7,
              15.3, and 7.7\% in CC genotype, respectively (P < 0.0001, P <
              0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.03). The 677 TT genotype was
              significantly associated with relapse in 5 years in 56.3\%,
              compared to 18.2\% in CT and 0\% in CC alleles. The overall 5
              years survival was significantly lower in 677 TT (50\%) compared
              with CC genotypes (92.3\%) (P = 0.001). No significant relation
              was found between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and the risks of
              therapy induced complications or relapse rate in the studied ALL
              patients. MTHFR TT genotype is significantly associated with
              increased mucosal and hepatic toxicity during methotrexate
              therapy as well as increased relapse rate in childhood ALL.
              Because of the relatively high prevalence of the TT genotype in
              the studied Egyptian children with ALL, MTHFR gene polymorphisms
              should be studied in large multicenter studies; and dosage

              When Thal is given in combination with chemotherapies or Dex,
              endothelial cell and monocyte PCA may be induced through
              phosphatidylserine exposure, or TF expression. Induction may be
              protracted by Thal, which has an antiangiogenic activity.

              730,000/$\mu$l total microparticles based on light-scattering
              measurements. A median of 27,000/$\mu$l microparticles in PRP
              were of platelet origin and 120,000/$\mu$l annexin V+, and of
              these, 24,000/$\mu$l were dual-positive procoagulant platelet
              microparticles. Double centrifugation of PRP removed 99\% of
              platelets, but also 80\% of annexin V+ CD41+, 93\% of annexin V+
              CD41-, and 58\% of annexin V- CD41+ microparticles. Loss of
              microparticles with centrifugation varied from individual to
              individual. Microparticle counts after isolation by
              centrifugation and double washing were not significantly
              different than counts in the original PFP sample, but lower than
              in PRP. Freeze-thawing of PFP had no effect on platelet
              microparticle counts, but slightly increased annexin V+, CD41-
              counts. Freeze-thawing of isolated washed microparticles resulted
              in a 30-50\% increase in annexin V+ microparticles. PRP contains
              large numbers of cellular microparticles, including platelet and
              annexin V+ microparticles, which are lost to varying degrees when
              PRP is double centrifuged to remove platelets. Microparticles
              remaining in PFP can be recovered by high-speed centrifugation
              without loss compared to the original PFP sample. Freeze-thawing
              has variable effects on microparticle counts depending on the

              Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate agent of consolidation and
              maintenance therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
              Despite its clinical success, MTX can be associated with serious
              toxicities resulting in treatment interruption or
              discontinuation, impacting disease outcome. There is evidence
              that MTX toxicity can be affected by polymorphisms in genes
              encoding for drug-metabolizing enzymes such as MTHFR. Therefore,
              we aimed to investigate the influence of MTHFR C677T and A1298C
              polymorphisms on the frequency of MTX-related toxicity, disease
              outcome and patients' survival. MTHFR polymorphisms were assessed
              in 50 adult patients with de novo ALL using real-time PCR.
              Patients were followed-up for the development of haematologic
              and/or nonhaematologic toxicity and assessment of clinical
              outcome. Frequency of C677T polymorphisms was 42\% for TT, 24\%

              associated with neutropaenia, hepatic and gastrointestinal

              treatment with various agents ('encryption-decryption'). We
              evaluated the influence of lipopolysaccharide stimulation on
              expression of TF antigen and activity on/in THP-1 human leukemia
              monocytic cells. Prior to stimulation, there were 240 $\pm$ 60 TF
              molecules/cell on the cell surface and 510 $\pm$ 180
              molecules/cell in lysates (n = 8). Upon stimulation, TF antigen
              increased 10-fold on the cell surface and 16.5-fold in lysates.
              Coincidently, the intact cell factor (F)Xa generation by TF/FVIIa
              increased 11-fold. Correspondingly, TF-induced clotting activity
              increased 35.7 $\pm$ 4.9-fold. The KM of the TF/FVIIa complex
              formed on the THP-1 surface and cell lysates for FX was 0.73
              $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.41 $\pm$ 0.02 $\mu$mol/l and the kcat 59.4 $\pm$
              1.8 and 44.6 $\pm$ 0.1 s, respectively. For isolated and
              relipidated THP-1 cell TF, the efficiency of FXase was lower (KM
              = 1.54 $\mu$mol/l and kcat = 12.0 s). A similar comparison of
              isolated/relipidated vs. cell-surface TF in the synthetic
              coagulation proteome and corn trypsin inhibitor blood showed that
              the cell-surface TF-induced thrombin generation is more than
              100-fold more efficient than that induced by purified/relipidated
              TF. These data indicate that the increase in monocytic cell TF
              activity upon stimulation is primarily related to an increased
              expression of TF protein, and that significantly higher specific
              activity of TF presented on cells than that of purified and
              relipidated protein suggests the presence of the cell membrane
              components which substantially enhance TF function.",

              associated with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) and extra-nodal
              natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL) is a rare
              life-threatening disorder. This disease is easily misdiagnosed
              because of its varied presentations. PATIENT CONCERNS: An
              18-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a history of
              edema in the lower limbs and intermittent fever lasting for more
              than 1 month. At admission, she had severe liver injury of
              unknown etiology. Laboratory test results revealed pancytopenia,
              hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia.
              Results of serologic tests for EBV were positive. Results of a
              skin biopsy indicated EBV-positive NK/T-cell lymphoma, and bone
              marrow aspiration revealed focal hemophagocytosis and atypical
              lymphoid cells. DIAGNOSIS: On the basis of these findings, we
              diagnosed the case as extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma-associated
              HPS (natural killer/T-cell lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic
              syndrome), which is commonly induced by CAEBV. INTERVENTIONS:
              Treatment consisted of general management of hepatitis,
              supplemented with albumin and empirical antibiotic therapy.
              OUTCOMES: The patient died from massive gastrointestinal
              hemorrhage a week after she was discharged from the hospital.
              LESSONS: ENKL and HPS present with varied features and are
              generally fatal; therefore, clinicians should proceed with
              caution in suspected cases. HPS should be considered when the
              patient presents with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia,
              and liver failure. When HPS is suspected, clinicians should
              determine the underlying cause, such as severe infection,
              including infection with viruses such as EBV; genetic
              predisposition; or underlying malignancies, especially lymphoma

              associated with a complex coagulopathy. In spite of substantial
              recent improvements in treatment regimens, hemorrhagic death
              remains the main cause of induction failure. In this review, we
              delineate recent understanding of the pathophysiology and
              management of the hemorrhagic diathesis of APL. RECENT FINDINGS:
              Laboratory and clinical data suggest that the malignant
              leukocytes mediate the hemorrhagic diathesis associated with APL
              through multiple mechanisms which lead to a combination of
              consumptive coagulopathy and primary hyperfibrinolysis. Exposure
              of tissue factor and Annexin II by the leukemic blasts is the
              main determinants of these processes. Promyelocyte-derived
              microparticles have recently been implicated in the coagulopathy
              as well. Total white cell count and platelet count have emerged
              as good general predictors of hemorrhagic death, along with the
              different routine hemostatic parameters. Prompt treatment with
              all-trans retinoic acid, with or without arsenic trioxide, is the
              most important step in preventing bleeding complications.
              Repletion of coagulation factors and platelets with blood
              products remains the mainstay of supportive treatment, whereas
              the role of recombinant soluble thrombomodulin is currently being
              investigated. SUMMARY: The coagulopathy of APL is multifactorial,

              and analyzed data with regard to the treatment of episodes of
              severe acquired hypofibrinogenemia occurring during the induction

              RESULTS: In total, 15 of the 37 AIEOP centers invited to join the

              declaring to react to severe acquired hypofibrinogenemia (<70

              quality of life experienced by patients with a new diagnosis of
              AML across induction chemotherapy. METHODS: A prospective,
              longitudinal descriptive study design was implemented to evaluate
              symptoms and health-related quality of life at the time of
              enrollment through 6 weeks postdiagnosis and identify who might
              be most at risk of experiencing high symptom burden. RESULTS: A
              total of 19 participants were included in this analysis. Moderate
              to severe levels of distress were present in 25\% to 50\% of
              participants, depending on timing in treatment. Females and those
              with a previous history of a psychological disorder reported
              higher symptom burden during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
              indicate that adults with AML experience multiple distressing

              PRACTICE: Timely routine multidimensional assessment of symptoms
              in individuals undergoing induction chemotherapy treatment for
              AML is critical as they may be experiencing multiple concurrent

              clot formation in ITP. Blood from ITP patients (n = 12) was drawn
              into tubes containing 3·2\% citrate and corn trypsin inhibitor
              18·3 $\mu$g/ml. WB [mean platelet count 22 $\times$ 10(9) /l
              (range 0-42)] was spiked in vitro with buffer, donor platelets
              (+40 $\times$ 10(9) /l), rFVIIa (1 or 4 $\mu$g/ml), fibrinogen (1
              or 3 mg/ml), or combinations of rFVIIa and fibrinogen.
              Coagulation profiles were recorded by tissue factor (0·03 pmol/l)
              activated thromboelastometry. Coagulation in ITP was
              characterized by a prolonged clotting time (CT, 1490 s (mean))
              and a low maximum velocity (MaxVel, 3·4 mm $\times$ 100/s) and
              maximum clot firmness (MCF, 38·2 mm). Fibrinogen showed no
              haemostatic effect, whereas rFVIIa reduced the CT and increased
              the MaxVel. The combination of fibrinogen and rFVIIa revealed a
              significant synergistic effect, improving all parameters (CT 794
              s, MaxVel 7·9 mm $\times$ 100/s, MCF 50·7 mm) even at very low

              fibrinogen corrects the coagulopathy of ITP even at very low

              an increased risk for thrombosis. These facts suggest the

              profile due to an increased amount of platelet- and red
              cell-microparticles, an increased resistance to protein C and the
              formation of a clot more resistant to fibrinolysis due to
              augmented levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which
              might reflect an endothelial damage/activation in ITP patients.

              ROTEM\textregistered{} profiles showed a prolonged clotting time

              of AnxA2 function relates to its interaction with small Ca(2+)
              -dependent adaptor proteins called S100 proteins, which is the
              topic of this review. The interaction between AnxA2 and S100A10
              has been very well characterized historically; more recently,
              other S100 proteins have been shown to interact with AnxA2 as
              well. The biochemical evidence for the occurrence of these
              protein interactions will be discussed, as well as their
              function. Recent studies aiming to generate inhibitors of S100
              protein interactions will be described and the potential of these
              inhibitors to further our understanding of AnxA2 S100 protein
              interactions will be discussed.",

              Subjects aged 18-60 yr with ALL (n = 152, 69.1\% male)

              acid (ATRA) therapy has demonstrated a tremendous success in the
              first-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
              Actually, early death (ED) is currently thought as a major
              challenge in APL. ATO has been reported to inhibit platelet
              function in vitro, and whether it increases the ED rate by
              exacerbating the hemorrhagic symptoms remains to be investigated.
              METHODS: Effects of ATO on platelet aggregation and adhesion were
              evaluated in vitro and in thirty-two complete remission (CR) and
              four newly diagnosed APL patients. Furthermore, concentrations of
              plasma total arsenic were monitored in APL patients via ICP-MS.
              RESULTS: The inhibition of platelet function, either aggregation
              or adhesion, did occur in vitro when the concentration of ATO
              reached 2 $\mu$mol/L. However, in CR APL patients receiving ATO
              with normal platelet count, the platelets responded normally when
              being activated and so did those in the newly diagnosed patients
              with thrombocytopenia. Our data further showed that the
              conventional dosage of ATO reached a plasma concentration
              substantially below the required concentration to inhibit
              platelets. CONCLUSIONS: In the first-line treatment of APL, the
              use of ATO is safe and effective and does not compromise the
              hemostatic potential that may eventually increase ED rate.",

              haematology disorders like von Willebrand disease (VWD) and
              Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT). Replacement factors are very
              expensive although prophylactic drugs are affordable. OBJECTIVE:
              To study the prophylactic effects of tranexamic acid (TXA) for
              reduction of bleeding episodes in patients with VWD and GT in
              non-invasive conditions. METHODS: A controlled, double-blind
              before and after single-centre trial was performed in Amir-Kabir
              Hospital (Arak, Iran). The study was done on 17 patients with VWD
              and three patients with GT with minimum age of 2 years. Patients
              were received placebo for 6 months to evaluate the frequency and
              severity of bleeding and also to record the frequency of use of
              factor concentrates and platelet transfusion. After that,
              patients were given oral single dose of TXA 25 mg kg(-1) day(-1)
              for 6 months. The mentioned outcomes were studied and compared
              between two phases of study. Safety assessment was done in all
              patients. RESULTS: Tranexamic acid caused a significant reduction
              in number of Grade 1 and Grade 2 bleeding episodes in VWD
              patients (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01 respectively). In addition, TXA
              therapy was associated with significant decrease in the use of
              factor concentrates (P < 0.05). Number of bleeding episodes
              decreased in GT patients who used TXA; however, difference
              between two phases of studies was not significant (P = 0.1). TXA
              had no effect in the frequency of platelet transfusions in GT
              patients. TXA therapy was associated with headache, back pain and
              musculoskeletal pain. No case of allergy or thromboembolic events
              was seen following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest
              that TXA is safe and effective to reduce bleeding and use of
              factor concentrates in VWD patients. In addition, TXA therapy can
              decrease bleeding in GT patients.",

@ARTICLE{Sivapalaratnam_S2018-xg,
  title    = "Diagnosis of inherited bleeding disorders in the genomic era",
  author   = "{Sivapalaratnam S.}",
  abstract = "Inherited bleeding disorders (IBD) affect up to 1 in 10,000
              individuals for the most common disorder, von Willebrand disease,
              to only eight reported cases worldwide of alpha-2-antiplasmin
              deficiency. Those with an identifiable abnormality can be divided
              into disorders of coagulation factors (87\%), platelet count and
              function (8\%) and the fibrinolytic system (3\%). The remaining
              2\% are unclassifiable (1-3). Next to bleeding symptoms, patients
              with an IBD can manifest abnormalities in other organ systems,
              warranting an accurate and complete diagnosis that reflects the
              underlying molecular pathology. This includes predisposition to
              renal impairment, deafness or acute myeloid leukaemia (4).
              Despite the fact that IBD can be diagnosed through a combination
              of careful clinical assessment and laboratory assays of varying
              degrees of complexity, there are many where conventional
              approaches are inadequate. Improvements in phenotyping assays
              have enhanced the diagnostic toolbox, however genotyping offers
              the most precise diagnosis for some of these conditions. In the
              past, obtaining a genetic diagnosis was often challenging. It was
              not always clear which genetic tests could be undertaken. These
              tests were based on Sanger sequencing, and were costly.
              Furthermore, the assays were time consuming. Genes were tested
              sequentially rather than in parallel, which meant that for some
              patients, it could take years to reach a diagnosis. Thanks to the
              development of targeted sequencing platforms, many genes can now
              be analysed routinely in a timely fashion. Thanks to the relative
              ease of use of these platforms, their use should be incorporated
              into the work-up of patients with an IBD. The traditional
              stepwise testing approach may require multiple hospital visits to
              discuss test results and to add additional investigations. The
              cost of these interventions, which may require the patient to
              attend a specialist laboratory, and the consequent delays in
              diagnosis are compelling reasons for introducing genetic testing
              much earlier in the diagnostic process. In order to make sense of
              the vast amount of data generated by NGS and particularly by
              whole genome sequencing (WGS) in a manner that is clinically
              useful, a multi-disciplinary approach is essential, involving
              clinicians, bioinformaticians and genetic scientists. One such
              panel is the ThromboGenomics (TG), a targeted NGS panel, that has
              been developed in Cambridge, UK (5). Version 3.0 of the platform
              contains 78 genes with a confirmed role in bleeding/ thrombotic
              disorders. These include coagulation pathways and platelet
              disorders due to defects important for platelet formation,
              morphology or function. By selecting only genes with an
              established role in inherited coagulation, platelet and
              thrombotic disorders, clinical utility is enhanced. The
              technology allows rapid addition of new genes once they have been
              approved by the Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC)
              for Genomics as described below. To date, more than 1450 samples
              have been processed by the TG pipeline. The speed at which
              investigations can be undertaken, and the reducing WGS costs,
              will promote its role. In parallel, ongoing bio-banking efforts
              for peripheral blood samples and analysis of genome-wide markers
              will allow linkage of genetic loci to specific phenotypic traits.
              When a clinical question, such as the cause of abnormal bleeding
              arises, a bioinformatics pipeline will analyse genes related to
              IBD for pathological variants. In summary, we suggest the next
              approach for the investigation of patients with a suspected
              inherited bleeding disorder should be as follows (6): 1. Detailed
              history taking including a. Clinical assessment of presence and
              severity of bleeding symptoms using the International Society on
              Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Bleeding Assessment Tool (BAT)
              (20), to generate scores from bleeding history. b. Age of
              symptoms onset. c. Family history; it is important to consider
              autosomal recessive inheritance of disorders in asymptomatic
              carriers, especially when parents are consanguineous. d. Platelet
              disorders can be part of multi-system disorders. A full physical
              examination may give clues facilitating diagnosis. In addition, a
              systems history should be taken. e. Diet, and certain products
              including herbs and caffeine can affect platelet function. In
              addition, malnourishment can result in factor deficiencies. f.
              Current medication 2. First-line investigations are available at
              most centres treating patients with an IBD that include a full
              blood count, APTT, PT, TT, Fibrinogen, VWF antigen and VWF
              activity. If a platelet disorder is suspected, platelet
              morphology and light transmission aggregometry should be
              undertaken. 3. Second-line testing is dependent on the outcome of
              previous testing. If a coagulation defect is suspected based on
              abnormal clotting studies, this could be followed up with
              specific factor assays. If all factors are normal, factor XIII
              and Alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency should be excluded. Findings
              can be confirmed using NGS. If a platelet disorder is suspected,
              rather than second-line testing, which is costly and
              time-consuming, NGS should be used. 4. A multidisciplinary team
              meeting to discuss patients, having input from clinicians,
              biomedical staff, geneticists and bioinformaticians. If there is
              ambiguity, or further phenotyping is required, then additional
              third-line tests could be suggested. The outcome should be
              documented and conveyed to the patient.",

  abstract = "Platelets are derived from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow that
              create the cellular machinery the platelet needs to participate
              in the different processes of primary hemostasis including
              adhesion, activation and clot formation at the site of injury.
              Defects related to megakaryocyte differentiation, platelet
              formation, and/or platelet function can result in bleeding.
              Patients with thrombopathies can present with mucous membrane
              bleeding but may also present with bleeding following trauma or
              surgery. In this review, we have classified inherited platelet
              bleeding disorders (IPD) according to their underlying defective
              pathway: transcription regulation, TPO signaling, cytoskeletal
              organization, apoptosis, granule trafficking, and receptor
              signaling. Platelet function testing has provided insights into
              the underlying molecular defects that can result in bleeding. A
              major step forward was made during the last 3 years using
              new-generation genetic approaches that resulted in the discovery
              of novel genes such as NBEAL2, RBM8A, ACTN1, and GFI1B for the
              well-known IPD that cause gray platelet syndrome,
              thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome, and autosomal dominant
              thrombocytopenias, respectively. In the near future, it is
              expected that a similar approach will identify many novel genes
              that cause IPD of unknown etiology, which are common. The future
              challenge will be to use a functional, systems biology approach
              to study the genes mutated in IPD and determine their roles in
              megakaryocyte and platelet biology and pathology. \copyright{}

              with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). The study objective was
              to assess the prevalence of activation of blood coagulation
              and/or activation of fibrinolysis in APL. Coagulation and
              fibrinolytic parameters relevant to the objective included
              antithrombin III, plasminogen, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation
              products and alpha-2 antiplasmin activity and antigen levels. The
              results of this study revealed consistently normal antithrombin
              III levels, both before and in the course of antileukaemic
              treatment. Plasminogen levels were slightly decreased or normal.
              However, a distinct alpha-2 antiplasmin activity deficiency in
              all patients was observed with levels even reaching zero in three
              patients, during chemotherapy. Alpha-2 antiplasmin activity
              levels were consistently lower than the alpha-2 antiplasmin
              antigen levels. The in vitro binding of alpha-2 antiplasmin
              activity to fibrin clots was severely reduced which appeared to
              be due to the reduced alpha-2 antiplasmin plasma levels. Upon
              crossed-immunoelectrophoresis against alpha-2 antiplasmin
              antiserum two alpha-2 antiplasmin antigen peaks were observed in
              the plasma of all nine patients. All abnormalities were
              reversible 4 d after completion of chemotherapy. In a second
              series of 12 consecutive APL patients we confirmed the
              consistency of the alpha-2 antiplasmin activity deficiency and
              normal antithrombin III plasma levels. In addition Protein C
              activity and antigen levels were normal or near normal in 10 and
              reduced in two patients. Thrombin-antithrombin III complexes were
              increased in 10 and normal in two patients. We conclude that some
              activation of blood coagulation is present in APL (increased
              thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels) but its contribution to
              the coagulopathy seems to be minor (normal antithrombin III and
              only slightly reduced protein C levels). The observed reduced
              alpha-2 antiplasmin content of the fibrin clot in vitro may
              result in vivo in a fibrin clot that is highly susceptible to
              fibrin degradation, thus aggravating the coagulopathy in APL.",

              life-threatening; therefore prompt diagnosis and recognition of
              any coagulation defect is imperative. Unfortunately haemorrhage
              remains a major cause of early death, preventing some from
              reaching treatment. The coagulopathy is caused directly or
              indirectly by the leukaemic cells through expression of
              activators of coagulation and fibrinolysis, proteases and
              cytokine generation, compounded by failure of platelet production
              due to marrow invasion. At presentation the predominant feature
              is usually hyperfibrinolysis. Since the introduction of all-trans
              retinoic acid (ATRA), patient outcome has dramatically improved;
              yet, haemorrhagic complications remain the most frequent cause of
              mortality. Thrombotic complications occur but are less well
              recognized and potentially underreported. Supportive measures and
              prompt initiation of ATRA currently represent the mainstay of
              treatment of the coagulopathy in patients with suspected APML,

              further decrease the associated haemorrhagic and thrombotic
              risks. In particular, it is unclear how to best predict and
              monitor the coagulopathy; whether there is a role for the early
              use of antifibrinolytics; the most appropriate trigger for giving

              population between 1 in 500 and 1 in 5000. They are either
              quantitative (type I) or qualitative (type II). Type II is
              subdivided into the more common, but less thrombogenic, type IIb
              deficiency caused by a defect in the heparin-binding region of AT
              and the less common, but more thrombophilic, type IIa variant
              caused by mutations in the thrombin-binding site. A pleiotropic

              the subject of debate. Plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrates are
              indicated for reversing the haemorrhagic diathesis found in
              congenital and acquired deficiencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
              report on the results of an observational study that evaluated
              the effects of fibrinogen concentrates in patients suffering from
              various forms of acquired severe hypofibrinogenaemia with
              life-threatening consumptive thrombo-haemorrhagic disorders
              (surgery, trauma and digestive haemorrhage), or underlying
              disease states that limit fibrinogen synthesis (hepatic
              dysfunction, haematological malignancies). RESULTS: Sixty-nine
              patients were identified and included, in whom most of the
              processes (62\%) corresponded to consumptive hypofibrinogenaemia.
              After a median dose of 4 g, a mean absolute increase of 1.09 g/l
              in plasma fibrinogen was measured and coagulation parameters were
              significantly improved (P < 0.001). Mortality rates of 32.3\% and
              44.2\% were reported after 24 h and 72 h, respectively.
              CONCLUSION: We conclude that the administration of fibrinogen
              concentrates in unresponsive, life-threatening haemorrhage with
              acquired hypofibrinogenaemia improves laboratory measures of
              coagulation, and may also be life saving. Although observational
              in nature, our data indicate a direct relationship between plasma
              fibrinogen levels and survival in acquired fibrinogen deficiency.
              Further studies are warranted to ascertain a clear relationship
              between fibrinogen levels and survival.",

  abstract = "1. A combination of single cell fluorescence and patch clamp
              techniques were used to study the mechanisms underlying
              thrombin-evoked Ca2+ signals in human erythroleukaemia (HEL)
              cells, a leukaemic cell line of platelet-megakaryocyte lineage.
              2. Thrombin caused a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+
              ([Ca2+]i), consisting of both release of Ca2+ from intracellular
              stores and influx of extracellular Ca2+. Mn2+ quench studies
              indicated that the thrombin-evoked divalent cation-permeable
              pathway was activated during, but not prior to, release from
              internal stores. 3. Thapsigargin (1 microM) irreversibly released
              internal Ca2+ from the same store as that released by thrombin
              and continuously activated a Ca(2+)-influx mechanism. The
              amplitude of the thrombin- and thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx
              displayed a marked single cell heterogeneity which showed no
              correlation with the size of the store Ca2+ transient. 4. In
              whole-cell patch clamp recordings, both thrombin and thapsigargin
              evoked an inwardly rectifying Ca2+ current which developed with
              little or no increase in current noise, showed no reversal in the
              voltage range -110 to +60 mV and was blocked by 1 mM Zn2+. The
              apparent divalent cation permeability sequence of this pathway
              was Ca2+ > > Ba2+ > Mn2+, Mg2+. The thapsigargin-evoked current
              density at -100 mV varied between 0.42 and 2.1 pA pF-1 in
              different cells. Thrombin failed to activate additional Ca2+
              current if it was added after the thapsigargin-induced inward
              current had fully developed. 5. These studies indicate that
              thrombin activates Ca2+ influx in HEL cells entirely via a
              Ca(2+)-store-release-activated Ca2+ current (Icrac) rather than
              via receptor-operated or second messenger-dependent Ca2+
              channels. The level of expression of Icrac appears to be a major
              factor in determining the duration of the thrombin-evoked [Ca2+]i
              response and therefore represents a means by which cells can
              exert control over [Ca2+]i-dependent events.",

              ability of PLTs to aggregate in the form of PLT concentrate (PC).
              Nevertheless, there are few reports that have studied the PLT
              function in blood samples obtained from recipients after PLT
              transfusion. In this study, this issue was addressed by examining
              the ability of PLTs to aggregate after being transfused into the
              blood stream. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PC was transfused to the
              patients with extremely low PLT counts resulting from
              chemotherapy. The maximum extent of PLT aggregation and size of
              the aggregates were compared between PLT in stored PC before
              transfusion with the PLT-rich plasma (PRP) from the recipients
              after transfusion and with PRP from patients with moderate
              decrease in PLT counts after chemotherapy. RESULTS: The maximum
              extent of PLT aggregation was significantly higher in PRP
              collected from the patients after transfusion compared to the
              extent obtained before transfusion. There were no significant
              differences in the maximum extents of PLT aggregation between the
              PRP collected from the recipients after PC transfusion and, in
              the same patients, when PLT counts were moderately low.
              CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the observed decreased in
              PLT aggregation after storage can improve in the body after
              transfusion, and transfused PLTs have similar aggregation ability

              thrombocytopenia received one transfusion of PCT and/or one
              transfusion of untreated (reference) apheresis PLTs. Hemostatic

              conducted in four countries and exploratory analyses to determine
              the relationship between bleeding and PLT count. STUDY DESIGN AND
              METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed on original data
              from the Italian trigger study, the US TRAP study, the Canadian
              febrile reaction study, and a clinical chart review from one

              RESULTS: A total of 897 patients with acute leukemia received
              10,506 PLT transfusions. Grade 3 or Grade 4 WHO bleeding
              frequency was 28.1 percent (252/897) but varied by country:
              Italy, 10.8 percent (27/250); United States, 36.4 percent

              29 (x10(9)/L). CONCLUSION: The study provides descriptive data on
              PLT use and frequency of bleeding. When PLT counts were 0x10(9)
              to 4x10(9) per L there was an eightfold increase in bleeding and
              a twofold risk increase when counts were 5x10(9) to 14x10(9) per

               patients requiring intensive PLT transfusion therapy lasting
               several weeks to months. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Medical
               records of patients with two or more PLT crossmatch assays
               performed between 2002 and 2010 were reviewed. All patients were
               refractory to random single-donor apheresis PLT units, defined
               as two consecutive 1-hour posttransfusion CCIs of less than
               7500. A commercial solid-phase adherence assay was used for
               crossmatching. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included. A
               median of four crossmatch assays were performed per patient
               (range, 2-17). Mean percent reactivity in initial (58.6\%)
               versus last (55.3\%) crossmatch assay for each patient
               demonstrated no trend toward progressive alloimmunization (p =
               NS). A total of 738 crossmatched PLT units were administered
               with a mean $\pm$ standard deviation CCI of 7000 $\pm$ 7900 (n =
               443 units with adequate 1-hr posttransfusion counts), a
               significant improvement over random PLTs (p < 0.001). Patients
               with an initial crossmatch reactivity of greater than 66\% were
               significantly more likely to demonstrate at least one
               panreactive crossmatch assay, impacting the availability of
               compatible PLTs for optimum transfusion support. One patient
               (1.4\%) developed WHO Grade IV bleeding. CONCLUSIONS:
               Progressive alloimmunization to mismatched antigens does not
               impact medium-term transfusion support with crossmatched PLTs.
               Increased reactivity in the initial crossmatch assay can serve
               as a trigger to initiate workup for HLA-matched PLTs as a
               second-line approach. However, for most patients, medium-term
               transfusion support with crossmatched PLTs offers an effective
               and rapid first-line approach to management of PLT transfusion

              30 days of treatment with either ATRA or chemotherapy, but more
              rapidly and to a greater extent in patients treated with ATRA.
              ATRA treatment was associated with a significant decrease in TF
              gene expression in bone marrow cells during the first 30 days of
              treatment, whereas IL-1 beta gene expression, which decreased in
              the cells of six patients treated with either chemotherapy or
              ATRA, actually increased in the remaining six patients treated
              with either chemotherapy or ATRA. In patients with APL, treatment
              with either chemotherapy or ATRA rapidly ameliorates the
              coagulopathy, as indicated by an abrupt decline in markers of
              clotting activation. An increase in cytokine gene expression
              (e.g. IL-1 beta) may provide an explanation for the persistent
              hypercoagulability observed in some patients with APL, regardless
              of therapeutic approach. Our data confirms and extends earlier

              chemotherapy usually require the placement of a central venous
              catheter (CVC). CVCs are frequently complicated by
              catheter-related central venous thrombosis (CVT), which has been
              associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism and
              catheter-related infection. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy
              and safety of thromboprophylaxis with s.c. low-molecular-weight
              heparin (nadroparin) administered once daily in a randomized
              placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with
              hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive
              patients with hematologic malignancies requiring intensive
              chemotherapy including autologous stem cell transplantation were
              eligible. The patients were randomized to receive nadroparin 2850
              antifactor Xa units once daily or placebo s.c. for 3 weeks.
              Venography was performed on day 21 after CVC insertion. Secondary
              outcomes were bleeding and catheter-related infection. RESULTS:
              In total, 113 patients were randomized to nadroparin or placebo,
              and 87 patients (77\%) underwent venography. In total, 11
              venographically proven catheter-related CVTs were diagnosed. The
              frequency of catheter-related CVT was not significantly different
              between study groups, namely four catheter-related CVTs in the
              placebo group [9\%; 95\% CI: 0.002-0.16] vs. seven
              catheter-related CVTs in the nadroparin group (17\%; 95\% CI:
              0.06-0.28). In addition, no difference in the incidence of
              catheter-related infection or bleeding was observed between the
              groups. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the actual risk for
              catheter-related CVT in patients with hematologic malignancies is
              lower than suggested in earlier studies in cancer patients.
              Although prophylactic administration of nadroparin appeared to be
              safe in this group of patients with a high risk of bleeding, it
              cannot be recommended for the prevention of catheter-related CVT

              chain, GPIIb-IIIa activation, and platelet PKC- heta (with normal
              other PKC isozymes) in a patient with inherited thrombocytopenia
              and abnormal platelet aggregation and secretion (Gabbeta et al
              1996, Blood 87: 1368-1376). These findings were associated with a
              heterozygous nonsense mutation in transcription factor RUNX1
              (also known as CBFA2 or AMl1) (Sun et al 2004, Blood 103:948-54).
              Haplodeficiency of RUNX1 has been associated with familial
              thrombocytopenia, impaired megakaryopoiesis, impaired platelet
              function and predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia. Because of
              the important role of PKC- heta in platelet activation and of
              RUNX1 in hematopoiesis, we addressed the hypothesis that PKC-
              heta is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. Studies were
              performed using human erythroleukemia (HEl) cells treated with
              phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h to induce
              megakaryocytic transformation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
              (ChIP) assay using anti- RUNX1 antibody revealed RUNX1 binding to
              chromatin in the PKC- heta 5; upstream region -1225/-1056 bp from
              ATG codon. This region has RUNX1 binding site ACCGCA at
              -1081/-1076 bp. EMSA revealed RUNX1 binding to -1081/-1076 site.
              Mutation of RUNX1 site resulted in reduction in the PKC- heta
              promoter activity in luciferase expression studies. RUNX1 siRNA
              mediated knockdown of endogenous RUNX1 in HEl cells was
              associated with reduction in both RUNX1 and PKC- heta protein
              expression. Our results indicate that PKC- heta is a direct RUNX1
              transcriptional target gene. These studies provide a mechanism
              for decrease in platelet PKC- heta protein associated with RUNX1
              haplodeficiency. RUNX1 dysregulation of PKC- heta in
              megakaryocytic cells is an important aspect of the abnormal
              platelet function and production associated with human RUNX1

              clot integrity and safety of fibrinogen concentrate (human) (FCH)
              in patients with afibrinogenemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
              multinational, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study of
              patients with afibrinogenemia > or = 6 years of age was conducted
              in the USA and Italy. Plasma was collected before and after
              infusion for PK analyses and evaluation by rotational
              thromboelastometry of maximum clot firmness (MCF) to assess clot
              integrity. Safety was assessed on the basis of adverse events and
              laboratory parameters. RESULTS: After a single dose of 70 mg
              kg(-1) body weight (b.w.) FCH in 14 patients, median incremental
              in vivo recovery was a 1.7 mg dL(-1) increase per mg kg(-1) b.w.,
              and median levels were 1.3 g L(-1) for fibrinogen activity and
              antigen 1 h after infusion. Median half-life (t(1/2)) was 77.1 h
              for fibrinogen activity and 88.0 h for antigen. Plasma recovery
              in children < 16 years old was similar to that in adults aged 16
              to < 65 years, but the t(1/2) and area under the curve were
              decreased, with an increased steady-state volume and clearance.
              MCF increased by a mean of 8.9 mm from baseline to 1 h after
              infusion of FCH (P < 0.0001). All four adverse events reported
              were mild, and none was serious or related to study drug.
              CONCLUSIONS: These PK findings confirm a rapid increase in plasma
              fibrinogen levels after infusion with FCH. Together with the clot
              integrity and safety data and published data on efficacy, the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Thrombosis is a common complication for breast cancer
              patients receiving chemotherapy. However, the mechanisms by which
              breast cancer chemotherapeutic agents increase this risk are
              largely uncharacterized. Nucleic acids released by injured cells
              may enhance coagulation via the activation of the contact
              pathway. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the effects of
              breast cancer chemotherapy agents on the release of cell-free DNA
              (CFDNA) and its relationship to thrombin generation using in
              vitro and in vivo methods. METHODS: CFDNA release and
              thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) levels were measured in plasma of
              breast cancer patients and healthy mice receiving chemotherapy.
              Venous whole blood and cultured cells were exposed to
              chemotherapy and CFDNA release and levels of DNA-histone
              complexes were measured. The procoagulant activity of isolated
              CFDNA was measured with calibrated, automated thrombin
              generation. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients receiving
              chemotherapy had elevated levels of CFDNA 24 h post-chemotherapy,
              a time-point at which elevated thrombin-antithrombin levels have
              been previously reported. Treatment of healthy mice with
              doxorubicin, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil increased CFDNA
              release, with a corresponding elevation in TAT complex formation.
              Venous whole blood and neutrophils incubated with
              chemotherapeutic agents had elevated CFDNA in plasma or cell
              supernatants. In addition, incubation of venous whole blood with
              chemotherapy decreased histone-DNA complex levels. CFDNA released
              from epirubicin-treated whole blood significantly elevated
              thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner, and involved
              activation of the contact pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Release of CFDNA
              from chemotherapy-injured cells may represent a novel mechanism
              by which thrombosis is triggered in cancer patients.",

  abstract = "Background:Severe thrombocytopenia is a major risk factor for
              hemorrhage, but platelet function and bleeding risk at low
              platelet counts are poorly understood, because of the limitations
              of platelet function testing at very low platelet counts.
              Objectives:To examine and compare platelet function in severely
              thrombocytopenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
              myelodysplasia (MDS) with that in patients with immune
              thrombocytopenia (ITP). Methods:Whole blood flow cytometric
              measurement of platelet activation and platelet reactivity to
              agonists was correlated with the immature platelet fraction (IPF)
              and bleeding symptoms. Results:Patients with AML/MDS had smaller
              platelets, lower IPF and substantially lower platelet surface
              expression of activated glycoprotein (GP)IIb-IIIa and GPIb, both
              with and without addition of ex vivo ADP or thrombin
              receptor-activating peptide, than patients with ITP. In both ITP
              and AML/MDS patients, increased platelet surface GPIb on
              circulating platelets and expression of activated GPIIb-IIIa and
              GPIb on ex vivo activated platelets correlated with a higher IPF.
              Whereas platelet reactivity was higher for AML/MDS patients with
              bleeding than for those with no bleeding, platelet reactivity was
              lower for ITP patients with bleeding than for those with no
              bleeding. Conclusions:AML/MDS patients have lower in vivo
              platelet activation and ex vivo platelet reactivity than patients
              with ITP. The proportion of newly produced platelets correlates
              with the expression of platelet surface markers of activation.
              These differences might contribute to differences in bleeding
              tendency between AML/MDS and ITP patients. This study is the
              first to define differences in platelet function between AML/MDS
              patients and ITP patients with equivalent degrees of
              thrombocytopenia. \copyright{} 2011 International Society on

  abstract = "Background: Inherited thrombocytopenias (ITs) are heterogeneous
              genetic disorders that frequently represent a diagnostic
              challenge. The requirement of highly specialized tests for
              diagnosis represents a particular problem in resource-limited
              settings. To overcome this difficulty, we applied a diagnostic
              algorithm and developed a collaboration program with a
              specialized international center in order to increase the
              diagnostic yield in a cohort of patients in Argentina. Methods:
              Based on the algorithm, initial evaluation included collection of
              clinical data, platelet size, blood smear examination and
              platelet aggregation tests. Confirmatory tests were performed
              according to diagnostic suspicion, which included platelet
              glycoprotein expression, immunofluorescence for myosin-9 in
              granulocytes and platelet thrombospondin-1 and molecular
              screening of candidate genes. Results: Thirty-one patients from
              14 pedigrees were included; their median age was 32 (4-72) years
              and platelet count 72 (4-147)$\times$109L-1. Autosomal dominant
              inheritance was found in nine (64\%) pedigrees; 10 (71\%) had
              large platelets and nine (29\%) patients presented with syndromic
              forms. A definitive diagnosis was made in 10 of 14 pedigrees and
              comprised MYH9-related disease in four, while classic and
              monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome, gray platelet syndrome,
              X-linked thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenia 2 (ANKRD26 mutation)
              and familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute
              myelogenous leukemia were diagnosed in one pedigree each.
              Conclusions: Adoption of an established diagnostic algorithm and
              collaboration with an expert referral center proved useful for
              diagnosis of IT patients in the setting of a developing country.
              This initiative may serve as a model to develop international
              networks with the goal of improving diagnosis and care of

              clinical diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation
              (DIC), the validity of these systems for leukemia-associated DIC
              remains to be confirmed. METHODS: By analyzing 125 newly
              diagnosed acute leukemia patients, we investigated clinical and
              laboratory features of leukemia-associated DIC, and determined
              the validity of the two established criteria. RESULTS: A total of
              36 patients (29\%) were diagnosed with DIC according to expert
              opinion, a method regarded as the de facto gold standard.
              Leukemia-associated DIC is characterized by rare manifestation of
              organ failure because of thrombosis and no relevance of the
              platelet count for the diagnosis. The results of receiver
              operating characteristics analysis favored fibrin degradation
              product (FDP) rather than D-dimer as the fibrin-related marker
              test. Although prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen, and serum FDP
              levels were significantly different for patients with and without
              DIC, multivariate analysis identified FDP levels to be the only
              factor associated with DIC diagnosis. The cut-off level of 15
              microg/mL for FDP was found to be the most effective to
              differentiate DIC from non-DIC, resulting in diagnostic
              sensitivity and specificity of 92\% and 96\%, respectively. The
              diagnostic results for our patients produced with this FDP-based
              system were at least comparable with or superior to those
              obtained with the two currently available scoring systems.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an FDP-based criterion may
              be applicable for the diagnosis of leukemia-associated DIC.

              clinical use, prospective validation of this criterion is needed.",

              279 patients enrolled in the APL97 study conducted by the Japan
              Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG). RESULTS: Severe hemorrhage
              occurred in 18 patients (6.5\%). Although most of them were
              receiving frequent transfusions, the targeted levels of platelet
              counts (30 x 10(9)/L) and plasma fibrinogen (1.5 g/L) for this
              study were reached at the day of bleeding in only 71\% and 40\%,
              respectively. Nine of them succumbed to an early death, while the
              remaining nine patients eventually achieved complete remission
              (CR). The 5-yr event-free survival rate was 68.1\% for those who
              did not suffer severe hemorrhage, and 31.1\% for those who did (P
              < 0.0001). For patients who achieved CR, on the other hand, there
              was no difference in disease-free survival between patients with
              and without severe hemorrhage (P = 0.6043). Risk factor analysis
              identified three pretreatment variables associated with severe
              hemorrhage: initial fibrinogen level, white blood cell count, and
              performance status. Additionally, patients with severe hemorrhage
              were more easily prone to develop retinoic acid syndrome or
              pneumonia than patients without hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: These
              results indicate that fatal hemorrhage represents a major
              obstacle in curing APL, and that patients with such high-risk

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: It is commonly accepted that antibody-mediated
              removal of platelets represents a major mechanism of platelet
              destruction in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Although
              complement activation may participate in platelet clearance,
              frequency and specificity of complement activation have not yet
              been studied systematically in ITP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
              examined blood samples from 240 patients with ITP. Samples were
              assessed for the presence of free and bound platelet
              autoantibodies by a standard glycoprotein-specific assay
              (monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet
              antigens). The ability of all sera to fix complement to a panel
              of human platelets was investigated in a complement fixation (CF)
              assay. Fixation of C1q to isolated GP IIb/IIIa was assessed by
              flow cytometry. RESULTS: Glycoprotein-specific autoantibodies
              were detected as platelet-bound antibodies in 129 (54\%) and as
              additional free antibodies in 26 (11\%) and were undetectable in
              111 (46\%) patients. Assessing these subgroups for CF, 103
              (65\%), 21 (81\%), and 33 (30\%) sera gave positive results. If
              GP IIb/IIIa was absent from the test platelets, 81 (67\%) lost
              their ability to fix complement; if GP Ib/IX was absent, 37
              (30\%) lost their ability to fix complement. C1q fixation to
              immunobeads coated with GP IIb/IIIa was observed in 50\% of sera
              containing anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: In a
              significant number of patients with chronic ITP, platelet
              autoantibodies are capable of activating the classical complement
              pathway. CF is even present in ITP sera without detectable
              autoantibodies, indicating that current techniques for
              autoantibody detection may be insufficient. The major targets for
              complement-fixing autoantibodies in ITP are GP IIb/IIIa and GP

              receptors, which serve to localize proteolytic activity on the
              cell surface, have been identified on endothelial cells, blood
              cells, neuronal cells, and tumor cells. One such receptor is
              annexin II, a calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein that
              serves as a profibrinolytic co-receptor for tissue plasminogen
              activator and plasminogen on endothelial cells. Accumulating
              evidence suggests that impaired cell surface fibrinolytic
              assembly could lead to progressive atherothrombotic disease. In
              addition, dysregulation of annexin II expression in acute
              promyelocytic leukemia is an important mechanism for the bleeding
              diathesis associated with this malignancy.",

  abstract = "The diagnosis of inherited thrombocytopenias is difficult, for
              many reasons. First, as they are all rare diseases, they are
              little known by clinicians, who therefore tend to suspect the
              most common forms. Second, making a definite diagnosis often
              requires complex laboratory techniques that are available in only
              a few centers. Finally, half of the patients have forms that have
              not yet been described. As a consequence, many patients with
              inherited thrombocytopenias are misdiagnosed with immune
              thrombocytopenia, and are at risk of receiving futile treatments.
              Misdiagnosis is particularly frequent in patients whose low
              platelet count is discovered in adult life, because, in these
              cases, even the inherited origin of thrombocytopenia may be
              missed. Making the correct diagnosis promptly is important, as we
              recently learned that some forms of inherited thrombocytopenia
              predispose to other illnesses, such as leukemia or kidney
              failure, and affected subjects therefore require close
              surveillance and, if necessary, prompt treatments. Moreover,
              medical treatment can increase platelet counts in specific
              disorders, and affected subjects can therefore receive drugs
              instead of platelet transfusions when selective surgery is
              required. In this review, we will discuss how to suspect,
              diagnose and manage inherited thrombocytopenias, with particular
              attention to the forms that frequently present in adults.
              Moreover, we describe four recently identified disorders that
              belong to this group of disorders that are often diagnosed in
              adults: MYH9-related disease, monoallelic Bernard-Soulier

              predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML) is an
              inherited platelet disorder caused by a germline RUNX1 mutation
              and characterized by thrombocytopenia, a platelet function
              defect, and leukemia predisposition. The mechanisms underlying
              FPD/AML platelet dysfunction remain incompletely clarified. We
              aimed to determine the contribution of platelet structural
              abnormalities and defective activation pathways to the platelet
              phenotype. In addition, by using a candidate gene approach, we
              sought to identify potential RUNX1-regulated genes involved in
              these defects. Methods: Lumiaggregometry, $\alpha$-granule and
              dense granule content and release, platelet ultrastructure,
              $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 integrin activation and outside-in signaling
              were assessed in members of one FPD/AML pedigree. Expression
              levels of candidate genes were measured and luciferase reporter
              assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to study
              NF-E2 regulation by RUNX1. Results: A severe decrease in platelet
              aggregation, defective $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 integrin activation
              and combined $\alpha$$\delta$ storage pool deficiency were found.
              However, whereas the number of dense granules was markedly
              reduced, $\alpha$-granule content was heterogeneous. A trend
              towards decreased platelet spreading was found, and $\beta$3
              integrin phosphorylation was impaired, reflecting altered
              outside-in signaling. A decrease in the level of transcription
              factor p45 NF-E2 was shown in platelet RNA and lysates, and other
              deregulated genes included RAB27B and MYL9. RUNX1 was shown to
              bind to the NF-E2 promoter in primary megakaryocytes, and
              wild-type RUNX1, but not FPD/AML mutants, was able to activate
              NF-E2 expression. Conclusions: The FPD/AML platelet function
              defect represents a complex trait, and RUNX1 orchestrates
              platelet function by regulating diverse aspects of this process.
              This study highlights the RUNX1 target NF-E2 as part of the
              molecular network by which RUNX1 regulates platelet biogenesis

              with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has not been established.
              OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency and severity of bleeding
              events in patients with ITP, and the methods used to measure
              bleeding in ITP studies. PATIENTS/METHODS: We performed a
              systematic review of all prospective ITP studies that enrolled 20
              or more patients. Two reviewers searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL
              and the Cochrane registry up to May 2014. Overall weighted
              proportions were estimated using a random effects model.
              Measurement properties of bleeding assessment tools were
              evaluated. RESULTS: We identified 118 studies that reported
              bleeding (n = 10 908 patients). Weighted proportions for
              intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were 1.4\% for adults (95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 0.9-2.1\%) and 0.4\% for children (95\%
              CI, 0.2-0.7\%; P < 0.01), most of whom had chronic ITP. The
              weighted proportion for severe (non-ICH) bleeding was 9.6\% for
              adults (95\% CI, 4.1-17.1\%) and 20.2\% for children (95\% CI,
              10.0-32.9\%; P < 0.01) with newly-diagnosed or chronic ITP.
              Methods of reporting and definitions of severe bleeding were
              highly variable in primary studies. Two bleeding assessment tools
              (Buchanan 2002 for children; Page 2007 for adults) demonstrated
              adequate inter-rater reliability and validity in independent
              assessments. CONCLUSIONS: ICH was more common in adults and
              tended to occur during chronic ITP; other severe bleeds were more
              common in children and occurred at all stages of disease.
              Reporting of non-ICH bleeding was variable across studies.
              Further attention to ITP-specific bleeding measurement in

              during storage. Aims: We compared storage characteristics and
              clinical effectiveness of Mirasol-treated and non-treated
              apheresis platelet concentrates (PCs) stored in plasma or in
              additional solution SSP+. Methods: PCs were obtained from healthy
              donors with their written informed consent. PCs were collected
              using Trima Accel apheresis system into autologous plasma or into
              40\% plasma/60\% SSP+. Activation markers exposure was analyzed
              using flow cytometry before and after activaton on 0, 1, 3 and 5
              days of storage. The clinical effectiveness study included
              transfusions of PCs stored in plasma or SSP+ and treated or
              non-treated with Mirasol for patients with acute lymphoblastic
              leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia, who had a hemorrhagic
              syndrome of less than 2 points on the WHO scale. Results: A
              significant increase in the expression of platelet activation
              markers was observed during the storage period in all groups of
              PCs. P-selectin and phosphatidylserine expression in
              Mirasol-treated samples were significantly higher compared to the
              control ones already on the day of harvesting, and continued to
              grow during the storage. On the 5th day of storage, 20-50\% of
              platelets treated with Mirasol did not respond to the activation.
              This result agreed well with the sig-nificant decrease
              (approximately 2-fold) in the effectiveness (we compared the
              absolute and corrected platelets count increment at 24 h after
              transfusion) of transfusions of PCs treated with Mirasol.
              Transfusions of PCs stored in SSP+ were accompanied by a fewer

              changes, which may contribute to a risk of thrombosis. This in
              vitro study compares clot formation and structure between
              patients and healthy subjects. Clot formation is delayed in
              patients; ultimately, however, clot permeability is decreased.
              The thrombogenic structure of fibrin clots may contribute to the
              thrombotic risk in cirrhosis. ABSTRACT: Background and Objectives
              Patients with cirrhosis can be at risk of thrombotic
              complications due to an imbalance between hemostatic components.
              However, little is known on how the disease affects clot
              generation or how alterations in the structure of fibrin clots
              may affect the hemostatic function of these patients. Methods We
              investigated the formation and structure of clots generated with
              plasma and purified fibrinogen of 42 patients with cirrhosis.
              Clots generated with plasma and fibrinogen of 29 healthy
              volunteers were studied for comparison. Clot formation and
              structure were assessed by turbidity, permeation studies,
              confocal laser and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The extent
              of fibrinogen oxidation was assessed by measuring the carbonyl
              content of purified fibrinogen samples. Results Tissue factor and
              thrombin-induced clotting of plasma was delayed in patients. The
              clotting rate was also decreased, but change in turbidity, fibrin
              density and fiber thickness were largely comparable to healthy
              volunteers. Conversely, clot permeability was significantly
              decreased in patients. When clots were generated with purified
              fibrinogen, differences in clot formation and structure similar
              to those in plasma were found. The carbonyl content was increased
              in patient fibrinogen and correlated with disease severity and
              clot permeability. Conclusions Delayed clot formation in
              cirrhosis ultimately results in decreased clot permeability.
              Similar alterations in clots generated with purified fibrinogen
              suggest that modifications of the molecule are (partly)
              responsible. Taken together, these findings are indicative of
              hypercoagulable features of clots of patients with cirrhosis,
              which may explain the increased risk of thrombosis associated
              with this condition.",

              thrombocytopenic patients with hematological cancer. High
              platelet aggregation ruled out bleeding tendency in
              thrombocytopenic patients. SUMMARY: Background Methods for
              testing platelet aggregation in thrombocytopenia are lacking.
              Objective To establish a flow-cytometric test of in vitro
              platelet aggregation independently of the patient's platelet
              count, and examine the association of aggregation with a bleeding
              history in thrombocytopenic patients. Patients/methods We
              established a flow-cytometric assay of platelet aggregation, and
              measured samples from healthy individuals preincubated with
              antiplatelet drugs, and samples from two patients with inherited
              platelet disorders. Then, we included 19 healthy individuals and
              20 patients with platelet counts of $\leq$ 50 $\times$ 109 L-1 ,
              diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic
              syndrome. We measured platelet aggregation and platelet
              activation by platelet surface expression of activated
              glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, P-selectin and CD63 after addition of
              agonists: collagen-related peptide, thrombin receptor-activating
              peptide (TRAP), and ADP. Results The platelet aggregation assay
              showed a low intraserial coefficient of variation of $\leq$ 3\%.
              Similar results were obtained for platelet-rich plasma and
              isolated platelets at platelet counts of > 10 $\times$ 109 L-1 ;
              otherwise, platelet isolation was required. The platelet
              aggregation percentage decreased with increasing antiplatelet
              drug concentration. Platelet aggregation in patients was reduced
              as compared with healthy individuals: 42\% (interquartile range
              [IQR] 27-58) versus 66\% (IQR 60-67) for TRAP; 41\% (IQR 25-48)
              versus 70\% (IQR 69-72) for collagen-related peptide; and 44\%
              (IQR 30-53) versus 65\% (IQR 46-72) for ADP. Platelet activation
              after stimulation was reduced in patients and correlated with
              platelet aggregation (e.g. r = 0.78-0.81 when stimulated with
              collagen-related peptide). Platelet aggregation had a negative
              predictive value of 100\% for a bleeding tendency among patients.
              Conclusion The established platelet aggregation assay was
              applicable for thrombocytopenic patients, and improved the

              investigate the association between plasma levels of TCC and
              future risk of incident VTE in a nested case-control study, and
              to explore genetic variants associated with TCC using protein
              quantitative trait loci analysis of exome sequencing data.
              METHODS: We sampled 415 VTE cases and 848 age- and sex-matched
              controls from a population-based cohort, the Troms{\o} study.
              Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios
              with 95\% confidence intervals for VTE across quartiles of plasma
              levels of TCC. Whole exome sequencing was conducted using the
              Agilent SureSelect 50 Mb capture kit. RESULTS: The risk of VTE
              increased across increasing quartiles of plasma TCC, particularly
              for unprovoked VTE. Participants with TCC in the highest quartile
              (>1.40 complement arbitrary units/mL) had an odds ratio for

              strength and susceptibility to clot lysis in CIT patients. To
              identify factors associated with fibrinolytic profiles, and to

              Independent determinants of tissue-type plasminogen activator

              clot firmness was weaker and lysis times were shorter than in

              previous thromboembolic events, bleeding, and solid cancer.
              Ten‐year absolute risks of thromboembolism and bleeding were
              calculated and hazard ratios (HRs) were computed, controlling for
              matching factors. Results Among 32 141 hematological cancer
              patients, the 10‐year absolute risk of any thromboembolic or
              bleeding complication following hematological cancer was 19\%:
              3.3\% for MI, 3.5\% for ischemic stroke, 5.2\% for VTE, and 8.5\%

              of major bleeding in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is lacking.
              METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of ITP patients presenting to
              the ED with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20x109 /L)
              and bleeding in 4 academic hospitals from 2008 to 2016. We
              defined a major ITP bleed as a bleed at a critical site or
              causing hemodynamic instability. RESULTS: We identified 112 ITP
              patients (n=141 visits) who presented to the ED with platelets
              <20x109 /L and bleeding. Twenty-nine patients (26\%) had 32 ED
              visits with major bleeds. Risk factors for major bleeds were
              older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95\% confidence interval [CI]
              1.01-1.06), male sex (OR 3.25, 95\% CI 1.22-9.32), and more prior
              ITP therapies (OR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.10-1.87). Acute treatment of
              major bleeds required a median of 3 treatments (IQR 2-4), which
              included intravenous immune globulin (91\% of visits),
              corticosteroids (78\% of visits) and platelet transfusions (75\%
              of visits). Three patients (10\%) died, 9 (31\%) developed
              recurrent bleeds, 1 (3\%) developed arterial thrombosis and 1
              (3\%) had permanent neurological disability. Six patients
              presented with minor bleeding and subsequently developed a major
              bleed after a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3). All 6 patients had oral
              purpura and 4 of 6 had gross hematuria preceding the major bleed.
              CONCLUSIONS: Major ITP bleeds are associated with significant
              morbidity and mortality. Oral purpura and hematuria often
              preceded major bleeds. Further research is needed to refine the
              definition of a major ITP bleed and develop evidence-based
              treatment strategies.",

              similar efficacy and safety for rivaroxaban and standard
              anticoagulation for treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism
              (VTE). The rivaroxaban dosing strategy was established based on
              phase 1 and 2 data in children and through pharmacokinetic (PK)
              modeling. METHODS: Rivaroxaban treatment with tablets or the
              newly developed granules-for-oral suspension formulation was
              bodyweight-adjusted and administered once-daily, twice-daily, or
              thrice-daily for children with bodyweights of $\geq$30, $\geq$12
              to <30, and <12 kg, respectively. Previously, these regimens were
              confirmed for children weighing $\geq$20 kg but only predicted in
              those <20 kg. Based on sparse blood sampling, the daily area
              under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-24)ss ] and
              trough [Ctrough,ss ] and maximum [Cmax,ss ] steady-state plasma
              concentrations were derived using population PK modeling.
              Exposure-response graphs were generated to evaluate the potential
              relationship of individual PK parameters with recurrent VTE,
              repeat imaging outcomes, and bleeding or adverse events. A
              taste-and-texture questionnaire was collected for
              suspension-recipients. RESULTS: Of the 335 children (aged 0-17
              years) allocated to rivaroxaban, 316 (94.3\%) were evaluable for
              PK analyses. Rivaroxaban exposures were within the adult exposure
              range. No clustering was observed for any of the PK parameters
              with efficacy, bleeding, or adverse event outcomes. Results were
              similar for the tablet and suspension formulation. Acceptability
              and palatability of the suspension were favorable. DISCUSSION:
              Based on this analysis and the recently documented similar
              efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with standard
              anticoagulation, we conclude that bodyweight-adjusted pediatric
              rivaroxaban regimens with either tablets or suspension are
              validated and provide for appropriate treatment of children with

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Global hemostatic mechanism(s) in patients with
              disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are poorly
              understood. There are few diagnostic criteria of DIC based on
              overall or global hemostatic mechanisms. METHODS: We have
              assessed in detailed the dynamic global hemostatic changes using
              thrombin and plasmin generation assay (T/P-GA), clot fibrinolytic
              waveform analysis (CFWA) and not-activated rotational
              thromboelastometry (NATEM), in a young girl with DIC associated
              with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The ratios of endogenous
              thrombin potential (T-EP) and plasmin lag time (P-LT) relative to
              normal plasma was sourced from pooled normal plasma from healthy
              volunteers on T/P-GA. RESULTS: The inverse P-LT ratio prior to
              tranexamic acid (TXA) treatment was greater than the T-EP ratio
              (1.1-2.8 and 0.83-1.2, respectively). Significant reduction in
              inverse P-LT ratio (0.084-1.3) was observed after TXA treatment.
              The interval from clotting to the initiation of fibrinolysis
              (fibrinolysis lag time: FLT) in CFWA was significantly shorter
              than the control at onset (74.2-91.6 s vs 109 s), indicating
              enhanced fibrinolysis. Data from an adult with acute
              promyelocytic leukemia-associated DIC also supportively showed a
              high inverse P-LT ratio (2.1) and shortened FLT (83.7 s). The
              clotting time in patient whole blood using NATEM-mode during an
              episode of severe epistaxis markedly shortened beyond control,
              but returned to normal after the addition of an anti-tissue
              factor (TF) monoclonal antibody. CONCLUSION: The release of
              intravascular TF contributed to sustained activation of
              coagulation and subsequent fibrinolytic activity in this patient
              with AML-associated DIC, and T/P-GA could provide better

              that platelet transfusion induces an inflammatory response in
              vascular endothelial cells. BACKGROUND: We investigated
              haemostatic function and endothelial biomarkers before and after
              platelet transfusion in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood was sampled before, 1 and 24 h after
              platelet transfusion. Primary and secondary haemostasis was
              evaluated by whole blood aggregometry (Multiplate) and
              thromboelastography (TEG). Endothelial biomarkers (sICAM-1,
              syndecan-1, sThrombomodulin, sVE-Cadherin) and platelet
              activation biomarkers (sCD40L, TGF-beta) were investigated along
              with haematology/biochemistry analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-two
              patients were included. Despite continued low platelet counts,
              platelet transfusion normalised the median values of most TEG
              parameters and slightly increased platelet aggregation (all P <
              0·05). Endothelial biomarkers were not significantly affected by
              transfusion. The 1 h sCD40L level correlated positively with
              Syndecan-1 and soluble thrombomodulin delta values, biomarkers of
              endothelial damage (both P = 0·005). CONCLUSION: Platelet
              transfusion improved haemostasis, whereas post-transfusion
              increases in sCD40L were associated with endothelial damage,
              indicating that transfused platelets and platelet-derived
              pro-inflammatory mediators may have opposite effects on the

              transfusion on clot firmness in thrombocytopenic patients with in
              vitro-performed fibrinogen concentrate substitution. MATERIALS
              AND METHODS: Thirty patients with haematological malignancy
              admitted for platelet transfusion were included. Haemostatic
              effects from platelet transfusion and ex vivo addition of
              fibrinogen concentrate at three different doses were evaluated by
              thromboelastometry, with clot firmness as the primary endpoint
              (A30 ExTEM assay). Secondary endpoints were other
              thromboelastometry parameters, thrombin generation parameters,
              activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time
              PT, fibrinogen and factor XIII levels and a clinical bleeding
              score. RESULTS: Twenty patients (66\%) had clinical bleeding
              signs by prior to transfusion. Platelets increased from 17
              (range, 1-109) to 40 (range 2-139) $\times$ 10(9) L(-1) following
              transfusion, with a median corrected count increment of 16·7
              (range, 0·8-43·5). The A30 value increased significantly by
              platelet transfusion from 35 $\pm$ 11 to 47 $\pm$ 10 mm, with no
              changes in thrombin generation. Fibrinogen concentrate

              50 $\pm$ 9 mm, respectively) and reduced parameters of thrombin
              generation at high doses. Platelet transfusion, together with
              fibrinogen concentrate, further increased clot firmness. APTT and
              PT were within normal range, whereas fibrinogen levels were

              bleeding as a primary outcome; however, previous studies have
              shown a wide variation in the amount (5\%-70\%) and type of
              bleeding documented. Differences in the way bleeding has been
              identified, recorded, and graded may account for some of this
              variability. This study's aim was to compare trials' method to
              document and grade bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were
              collected via three methods: a review of study publications,
              study case report forms, and a questionnaire sent to the authors.
              Authors of randomized controlled trials of PLT transfusion that
              used bleeding as an outcome measure were identified from the
              searches reported by two recent systematic reviews. Twenty-four
              authors were contacted, and 13 agreed to participate. Data
              submitted were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: More recent
              studies with trained bleeding assessors, detailed documentation,
              and expanded grading systems have reported higher overall levels
              of bleeding. The World Health Organization grading system was
              widely used to grade bleeding, but there was no consistency in
              the bleeding grade definitions. For example, bleeding classified
              as Grade 2 in some studies (spreading petechiae) was classified
              as Grade 1 in other studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study has
              highlighted differences in the method of recording and grading

              petechiae) may cause patient distress. This systematic review's
              objective was to assess whether bleeding affects health-related
              quality of life (HRQoL) or illness perceptions or representations
              (IPs) in patients with hematologic malignancies or myelodysplasia
              (MDS). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched, in full, 12
              electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) up
              to January 7, 2013, for eligible randomized controlled trials
              (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies.
              RESULTS: A total of 6247 studies were initially identified; 5945
              studies were excluded on the basis of the abstract. A total of
              302 full-text articles were evaluated independently by two
              reviewers; of these, six studies within seven citations were
              eligible for inclusion. Two studies are still in progress, four
              studies within five citations were included in this review (one
              RCT, one prospective observational study, one interview study,
              and one Web-based survey). None of the included studies were
              designed to assess the impact bleeding had on HRQoL or IPs. The
              Web-based survey and observational study used two new
              patient-reported outcome scales which specifically assessed
              patient distress or concern due to bleeding. The majority of
              patients within these two studies either did not experience
              bleeding or did not have severe thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION:
              There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether bleeding is
              a significant clinical problem that affects patients' HRQoL or
              IPs in either patients with MDS or patients with hematologic
              malignancies. Rigorously designed studies to assess the scale of
              this problem in both of these groups of patients are required.",

              administration. The objectives of the current study were to
              measure hemostatic changes during HSCT. Study Design and Methods
              In this prospective analysis, changes in plasma biomarkers,
              platelets (PLTs), or endothelial cells (D-dimers,
              thrombin-antithrombin complex [TAT], microparticle activity as
              thrombin-generation potential [MPA], whole blood aggregation, von
              Willebrand factor) were measured before and immediately after
              HSCT. Furthermore, associations with clinical complications were
              recorded. Results A total of 54 patients were included in the
              study. Mean MPA and TAT increased significantly immediately after
              HSCT, returning to baseline the day after the procedure (p<0.01).
              No significant differences in engraftment for neutrophils and
              PLTs were found in patients presenting a high increase of TAT or
              MPA compared with those presenting with a smaller increase.
              Patients with a high increase in TAT and MPA had received a
              greater number of total mononucleated cells (p<0.001) and higher
              transplant volumes (p=0.002). Conclusions Infusion of stem cells

              thrombin generation. This finding was not associated with acute
              adverse events and did not influence engraftment. Further studies
              are needed to compare variable DMSO concentrations as well as
              DMSO-free products, to better address the influence of DMSO on

               RESULTS: Prespecified subgroup analysis found that the reduction
               in proportion of patients experiencing WHO Grade 2 to 4 bleeds
               (main trial outcome) seen in the prophylaxis arm was of greater
               magnitude in chemo/alloHSCT than autoHSCT patients (interaction
               p = 0.04). Analysis of secondary outcomes showed a shorter time
               to first bleeding episode with no prophylaxis in the
               chemo/alloHSCT group (hazard ratio, 1.84; 95\% confidence

               interaction p = 0.08). The increased number of days with Grade 2
               to 4 bleeds with a no-prophylaxis policy was similar in
               chemo/alloHSCT (rate ratio, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.10-3.26) and in
               autoHSCT patients (rate ratio, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.97). Both

               DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected to 30 days on PLT and
               red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, major bleeds, serious adverse
               events, critical care, and hematology ward stay. Data were
               costed using 2011 to 2012 UK unit costs and converted into US$.
               Sensitivity analyses were performed on uncertain cost variables.
               RESULTS: Across the whole trial no prophylaxis saved costs
               compared to prophylaxis: -$1760 per patient (95\% confidence
               interval [CI], -$3250 to -$249; p < 0.05). For autoHSCT patients
               there was no cost difference between arms: -$110 per patient
               (95\% CI, -$1648 to $1565; p = 0.89). For chemo/alloHSCT
               patients no prophylaxis cost significantly less than
               prophylaxis: -$5686 per patient (95\% CI, -$8580 to -$2853; p <
               0.01). The cost impact of no prophylaxis differed significantly
               between subgroups. Sensitivity analyses varying daily treatment
               costs and ward stay for chemo/alloHSCT patients reduced cost
               differences to -$941 per patient (p = 0.21) across the whole
               trial and -$2927 per patient (p < 0.05) in chemo/alloHSCT
               subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear whether a no-prophylaxis
               policy saves costs overall. In chemo/alloHSCT patients cost
               savings are apparent but their magnitude is sensitive to a
               number of variables and must be considered alongside clinical
               data showing increased bleeding rates. In autoHSCT patients
               savings generated through lower PLT use in no-prophylaxis arm
               were offset by cost increases elsewhere, for example, additional
               RBC transfusions. Cost-effectiveness analyses of alternative PLT
               transfusion policies simultaneously considering costs and
               patient-reported outcomes are warranted.",

               Similarly, more information is needed to define how recipient
               characteristics affect the frequency of TRAEs after PLT
               transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the multicenter
               Platelet Dose (``PLADO'') study, pediatric and adult
               hematology-oncology patients with hypoproliferative
               thrombocytopenia were randomized to receive low-dose (LD),
               medium-dose (MD), or high-dose (HD) PLT prophylaxis for a
               pretransfusion PLT count of not more than 10 $\times$ 10(9) /L.
               All PLT units (apheresis or WBD) were leukoreduced. Post hoc
               analyses of PLADO data were performed using multipredictor
               models. RESULTS: A total of 5034 PLT transfusions to 1102
               patients were analyzed. A TRAE occurred with 501 PLT
               transfusions (10.0\%). The most common TRAEs were fever (6.6\%
               of transfusions), allergic or hypersensitivity reactions
               (1.9\%), and sinus tachycardia (1.8\%). Patients assigned HD
               PLTs were more likely than LD or MD patients to experience any
               TRAE (odds ratio for HD vs. MD, 1.50; 95\% confidence interval,
               1.10-2.05; three-group comparison p = 0.02). PLT source and ABO
               matching status were not significantly related to overall TRAE
               risk. Compared to a patient's first PLT transfusion, subsequent
               PLT transfusions were less likely to have a TRAE reported,
               primarily due to a lower risk of allergic or hypersensitivity
               reactions. CONCLUSION: The most important PLT unit
               characteristic associated with TRAEs was PLT dose per
               transfusion. HD PLTs may increase the risk of TRAEs, and LD PLTs

  abstract = "Background/Case Studies: Blood safety is a ``must'' in
              transfusion medicine. Over the recent past decades, major efforts
              were made to increase blood safety and reduce the risk of
              transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). The methods range from
              donor exclusion to pathogen-inactivation (PI) techniques. The
              last innovation in this field was the implementation of PI
              techniques for platelets. Nowadays, bacterial contamination of
              platelet components (PLTCs) is considered the most relevant risk
              for TTIs. Concerns have arisen about the function of, the in vivo
              recovery of, and the possibly increased demand for PI-treated
              platelets. The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA)
              recommends, among other approaches, the use of thrombelastography
              (TEG) for evaluating the need of platelet support. TEG is a
              laboratory test that measures viscoelastic changes of the entire
              clotting process. This recommendation prompted us to perform TEG
              before and 1 h after transfusion of PI platelets in a
              prospective, ongoing investigation. Study Design/Methods: At our
              institution, the Intercept system is applied for PI of PLTCs. All
              current patients of our Bone Marrow Transfusion (BMT) Unit (since
              April 2014) are included. We correlates the TEG results with
              post-transfusion platelet counts, corrected count increments
              (CCIs), coagulation parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), and
              clinical conditions. Up to now, seven patients (3 m/4 f; median
              age 45 y, range 32-56) diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia
              (AML) (4), Hodgkin disease (2), multiple myeloma (MM) (1), and
              acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (1) received a median of four
              PCs (range 1-19). Allogeneic BMT was performed in three patients
              and autologous BMT in one patient. CRP was elevated in two
              patients (>20 mg/dL). In none of the patients was the coagulation
              impaired. One patient presented with 40\% blasts in the bone
              marrow. The platelet support trigger is 10-20 g/L co-triggered by
              clinical condition. Results/ Findings: In 13 transfusion
              episodes, the TEG was measured before and 1 h after PC support.
              The platelet dose transfused was a median of 2.75 $\times$ 1011
              (range 2-4.1). The CCI was a median of 11.1 (range 3.27-17.3).
              six of seven patients showed marked improvement in all TEG
              parameters in which platelet function is involved, irrespective
              of CCI and the 1- value. In one patient, platelet transfusions
              failed to improve TEG, although the CCI was 6.17. This patient
              was diagnosed with blast crisis in AML. None of the investigated
              patients experienced bleeding. Conclusion: As verified by TEG
              measurements, Intercept PI inactivated platelets seems to have
              sufficient coagulation capacity. One-hour values, especially CCI
              values, may not be indicative of platelet function in all cases.
              Overall clinical conditions have a major influence on the success
              of platelet support.",

              life-threatening diagnosis requiring prompt initiation of
              therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Measurement of immature
              platelet (PLT) fraction (\%-IPF) differentiates PLT consumption
              or destruction from hypoproduction. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: Our
              study evaluated \%-IPF changes over the course of TTP treated
              with TPE and as a measure of treatment efficacy. Eleven
              idiopathic TTP patients, two human immunodeficiency virus
              (HIV)-associated TTP patients, and five non-TTP patients with
              thrombocytopenia were enrolled into our study. All patients were
              treated with TPE and had ADAMTS13 activity measured. RESULTS: All
              idiopathic TTP patients had a significantly increased \%-IPF and
              decreased absolute immature PLT count (A-IPC) and PLT count at
              presentation. An A-IPC value of less than 5 $\times$ 10(9) /L at
              presentation has 84.6\% sensitivity, 80\% specificity, and 91.7\%
              positive predictive value for diagnosing TTP. A concurrent steady
              decline in \%-IPF and increased PLT counts toward normal was
              observed in TTP patients undergoing TPE. The A-IPC, however,
              showed an increase and decrease curve that was not seen in the
              two HIV-associated TTP patients with no response to TPE and the
              five non-TTP patients. More importantly, reaching an A-IPC ratio
              of 3 compared to baseline value during TPE can readily
              differentiate idiopathic TTP from the other two groups and is
              correlated with good clinical responses to TPE. An abrupt
              increase of A-IPC during TPE was also noted in a TTP patient who
              relapsed 3 days before PLT count decrease. A-IPC is positively
              correlated with ADAMTS13 activity at presentation but negatively
              correlated with ADAMTS13 activity during recovery. CONCLUSION:
              A-IPC should be routinely analyzed for diagnosing and monitoring
              TTP patients.",

              dramatically decreased mortality in patients with immune
              thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP). However, there are
              few modern descriptions of residual causes of death from iTTP and
              complications associated with TPE. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This
              was a retrospective study in a multi-institutional cohort of 109
              patients with iTTP between 2004 and 2017. Complications of TPE
              were analyzed in a subset of this cohort (74 patients
              representing 101 treatment courses). RESULTS: Death occurred in 8
              of 109 patients (7.3\%) and in 8 of 219 captured episodes of
              acute iTTP (mortality rate per episode: 3.7\%). Neither the
              number of TPE treatments nor length of hospitalization predicted
              mortality. The majority of deaths (5/8) were associated with
              delay in the diagnosis of iTTP or initiation of TPE or
              presentation to the hospital in a moribund state. A subset of
              patients (N = 74) was analyzed for TPE-related complications.
              Most patients (56/74; 76\%) had at least one minor or major
              complication of TPE. Seven of 101 (6.9\%) discrete treatment
              courses were associated with one or more severe complications,
              including anaphylaxis and line-associated infections and
              thrombosis. Overall, the most frequent adverse events were mild
              allergic (urticarial) transfusion reactions, which affected 34 of
              101 (34\%) treatment courses. One patient died from a TPE-related
              complication, line-associated bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Early
              identification of patients with iTTP and the rapid initiation of
              TPE are paramount in preventing mortality. While TPE was
              associated with a high rate of adverse events, the vast majority
              were treatable and TPE-related mortality is low.",

              of hemostatic integrity, presenting an incomplete picture of
              coagulation in these patients. Viscoelastic tests (VETs), such as
              rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and thromboelastography

              cumulative effects of blood components and all stages of the
              coagulation and fibrinolytic processes. The utility of VETs has
              been demonstrated since the late 1960s in guiding blood component
              therapy for patients undergoing liver transplantation. Since
              then, the scope of viscoelastic testing has expanded to become
              routinely used for cardiac surgery, obstetrics, and trauma. In
              the past decade, VETs' expanded usage has been most significant

              produces a spectrum of coagulopathy and fibrinolytic alterations
              ranging from shutdown to hyperfibrinolysis that are common to
              TIC, MAC, and hematologic malignancies. There is expanding

              syndrome that results from a combination of humoral and

              megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Autoantibody-mediated ITP also

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic platelet transfusions are
              administered to prevent bleeding in haemato-oncological patients.
              However, bleeding still occurs, despite these transfusions. This
              practice is costly and not without risk. Better predictors of
              bleeding are needed, and flow cytometric evaluation of platelet
              function might aid the clinician in identifying patients at risk
              of bleeding. This evaluation can be performed within the hour and
              is not hampered by low platelet count. Our objective was to
              assess a possible correlation between bleeding and platelet
              function in thrombocytopenic haemato-oncological patients.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion was possible for admitted
              haemato-oncology patients aged 18 years and above. Furthermore,
              an expected need for platelet transfusions was necessary.
              Bleeding was graded according to the WHO bleeding scale. Platelet
              reactivity to stimulation by either adenosine diphosphate (ADP),
              cross-linked collagen-related peptide (CRP-xL), PAR1- or
              PAR4-activating peptide (AP) was measured using flow cytometry.
              RESULTS: A total of 114 evaluations were available from 21
              consecutive patients. Platelet reactivity in response to
              stimulation by all four studied agonists was inversely correlated
              with significant bleeding. Odds ratios (OR) for bleeding were
              0·28 for every unit increase in median fluorescence intensity
              (MFI) [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0·11-0·73] for ADP; 0·59
              [0·40-0·87] for CRP-xL; 0·59 [0·37-0·94] for PAR1-AP; and 0·43
              [0·23-0·79] for PAR4-AP. The platelet count was not correlated
              with bleeding (OR 0·99 [0·96-1·02]). CONCLUSION: Agonist-induced
              platelet reactivity was significantly correlated to bleeding.
              Platelet function testing could provide a basis for a
              personalized transfusion regimen, in which platelet transfusions

              of ATP-binding cassette transporters, is distributed in a variety

              is responsible for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
              numerous drugs, especially antiviral drugs, antitumor drugs, and
              diuretics. In this regard, the functional role of MRP4 is
              affected by a number of factors, such as genetic mutations;
              tissue-specific transcriptional regulations; post-transcriptional
              regulations, including miRNAs and membrane internalization; and

              restrains abnormal immature megakaryocyte expansion. How GATA1
              coordinates these fundamental processes is unclear. Previous
              studies of synthetic and naturally occurring mutant GATA1
              molecules demonstrate that DNA-binding and interaction with the
              essential GATA1 cofactor FOG-1 (via the N-terminal finger) are
              required for gene expression in terminally differentiating
              megakaryocytes and for platelet production. Moreover, acquired
              mutations deleting the N-terminal 84 amino acids are specifically
              detected in megakaryocytic leukemia in human Down syndrome
              patients. In this study, we have systematically dissected GATA1
              domains required for platelet release and control of
              megakaryocyte growth by ectopically expressing modified GATA1
              molecules in primary GATA1-deficient fetal megakaryocyte
              progenitors. In addition to DNA binding, distinct N-terminal
              regions, including residues in the first 84 amino acids, promote
              platelet release and restrict megakaryocyte growth. In contrast,
              abrogation of GATA1-FOG-1 interaction leads to loss of
              differentiation, but growth of blocked immature megakaryocytes is
              controlled. Thus, distinct GATA1 domains regulate terminal
              megakaryocyte gene expression leading to platelet release and
              restrain megakaryocyte growth, and these processes can be
              uncoupled. Copyright \copyright{} 2005, American Society for

              serious side-effects of severe thrombocytopenia in haematology
              patients. ICH is rare, but can have devastating consequences
              (death or major morbidity). It is unknown why some patients with
              severe thrombocytopenia bleed and others do not. STUDY AIMS:
              Primary aim was to identify risk factors for ICH in patients with
              haematological malignancies. Secondary aims were to identify
              short-term outcomes for these patients at 30 days (major
              morbidity and mortality) and produce a more accurate estimate of
              ICH incidence in this population. This information is key to
              identifying means to improve treatment and quality of care.
              METHODS/ANALYSIS: This is a UK-wide case-control study of ICH
              nested within a 4-year prospective surveillance study set up
              specifically for the case-control study. Each case will be
              matched to one control. Cases will be adult haematology patients
              ($\geq$16 years) who have had any type or severity of ICH who are
              receiving, about to receive or have just received myeloablative
              chemotherapy (defined as chemotherapy expected to cause a
              significant thrombocytopenia 5 days) or a haemopoietic stem cell
              transplant. Only patients being treated with curative intent will
              be included. Controls will be patients who fulfil the same
              inclusion criteria as cases (apart from ICH) and were treated at
              the same hospital immediately before the index case. Cases and
              controls will be matched to type of treatment (myeloablative
              chemotherapy or haemopoietic stem cell transplant). Hospitals
              across the UK will participate in a monthly email reporting
              strategy (started June 2011), as to whether a case of ICH
              occurred during the preceding calendar month. Case and control
              forms will be sent to any hospital reporting an eligible case.
              Conditional logistic regression will be used to calculate ORs.

              of pretreatment plasma fibrinogen levels in patients with diffuse
              large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) METHODS: Data from 372 patients
              with DLBCL, diagnosed and treated between 2004 and 2013 at two
              Austrian centres, were evaluated retrospectively. The prognostic
              influences of plasma fibrinogen levels and other factors,
              including age, tumour stage and the National Comprehensive Cancer
              Network-International Prognostic Index, on 5-year overall
              survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) were studied
              using Kaplan-Meier curves as well as univariate and multivariate
              Cox regression models. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed
              that a high fibrinogen plasma level is associated with decreased
              5-year OS and 5-year DFS in patients with DLBCL (p<0.001,
              log-rank test). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, elevated
              serum fibrinogen was found to be an independent marker of poor
              clinical outcome: 5-year OS (HR=1.69, 95\% CI 1.06 to 2.72,

              clot lysis time but not by the euglobulin lysis time. Paper
              chromatography of the supernatant and euglobulin fractions as
              prepared for the euglobulin lysis time test from plasma with
              added EACA demonstrated that some 85\% of the EACA was present in
              the supernatant, normally discarded during the test. Similarly,
              cellulose-acetate electrophoresis of the supernatant and
              euglobulin fractions from plasma containing Trasylol demonstrated
              the drug in the supernatant only. These findings indicate that
              when acetic acid is added to plasma containing EACA or Trasylol
              only a small proportion of the drug is precipitated with the
              euglobulin fraction. The euglobulin lysis time is thus an
              inaccurate index of the neutralization of hyperfibrinolysis by
              antifibrinolytic drugs.",

              the development of hypofibrinogenemia. We retrospectively

              patients who had been administered 1 mg/kg/day (1 mg/kg group) or
              2 mg/kg/day (2 mg/kg group) methylprednisolone for the treatment
              of Grade II to IV acute GVHD. Hypofibrinogenemia had developed in
              8 of the 15 patients (53\%) by day 50 after the start of steroid
              treatment, and was observed in 2 of 6 patients in the 1 mg/kg

              Mutations in Btk are involved in impaired B-cell maturation in
              X-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Btk has been investigated for
              its role in platelet activation via activation of the effector

              membrane glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Because of its role in
              hematopoietic cell signaling, Btk has become a target in the
              treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell
              lymphoma; the covalent Btk inhibitor ibrutinib was recently
              approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of
              these conditions. Antihemostatic events have been reported in
              some patients taking ibrutinib, although the mechanism of these
              events remains unknown. We sought to determine the effects of Btk

              of platelet activation, spreading, and aggregation. Our results
              show that irreversible inhibition of Btk with two ibrutinib

              phosphorylation of Btk, P-selectin exposure, spreading on
              fibrinogen, and aggregation under shear flow conditions.
              Short-term studies of ibrutinib analogs administered in vivo also
              showed abrogation of platelet aggregation in vitro, but without
              measurable effects on plasma clotting times or on bleeding in

              are a major source of PAI-1 within the vascular wall, and PAI-1

              and activity production significantly in these cells up to
              20-fold. OSM upregulated mRNA specific for PAI-1 up to 4.5-fold

              in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs). To identify genes
              regulated by NFAT5 we compared wild-type MEFs (WT-MEFs) to MEFs
              in which mutation of the NFAT5 gene inhibits its transcriptional
              activity (Null-MEFs). In WT-MEFs adding NaCl to raise osmolality
              from 300 to 500 mosmol/kg for 24 h increases expression of 167
              genes and reduces expression of 412. Raising osmolality through
              multiple passages (adapted cells) increases expression of 196
              genes and reduces expression of 528. In Null-MEFs, after 24 h of
              high NaCl, expression of 217 genes increase and 428 decrease,
              while in adapted Null-MEFs 143 increase and 622 decrease. Fewer
              than 10\% of genes are regulated in common between WT- and
              null-MEFs, indicating a profound difference in regulation of
              high- NaCl induced genes induced by NFAT5 compared with those
              induced in the absence of NFAT5. Based on our findings we suggest
              a mechanism for this phenomenon, which had previously been
              unexplained. The NFAT5 DNA-binding motif (osmotic response
              element) is overrepresented in the vicinity of genes that NFAT5
              upregulates, but not genes that it downregulates. We used Gene
              Ontology and manual curation to determine the function of the
              genes targeted by NFAT5, revealing many novel consequences of

              A phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation study of anti-CD19
              JWCAR029 was conducted in refractory B-NHL (NCT03355859) and 10
              patients received CAR T cells at an escalating dose of 2.5
              $\times$ 107(n = 3), 5 $\times$ 107(n = 4), and 1 $\times$ 108(n
              = 3) cells. Core needle biopsy was performed on tumor samples
              collected from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients on Day -6
              (1 day before lymphodepletion) and on Day 11 after CAR T-cell
              infusion when adequate CAR T-cell expansion was detected.
              RESULTS: The overall response rate was 100\%, with 6 of 9
              (66.7\%) evaluable patients achieving complete remission. The
              most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia

              30\%), and hypofibrinogenemia (2/10, 20\%). Grade 1 cytokine
              release syndrome occurred in all patients and grade 3
              neurotoxicity in 1 patient. The average peak levels of peripheral
              blood CAR T cells and cytokines were similar in 3 different dose
              levels, but CAR T cells were significantly higher in patients
              achieved complete remission on Day 29. Meanwhile, RNA sequencing
              identified gene expression signatures differentially enriched in
              complete and partial remission patients. Increased

  abstract = "CD47 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface Ig superfamily
              member. CD47 mediates a variety of biological processes,
              including leukocyte adhesion/migration, T-cell activation,
              apoptosis, and phagocytosis due to physical interaction with
              various proteins (integrins, thrombospondin-1, and signal
              regulatory protein alpha [SIRP$\alpha$]). The CD47-SIRP$\alpha$
              interaction negatively regulates phagocytosis Enhanced CD47
              expression has been described on hematological and solid cancers,
              suggesting that CD47 may mediate cancer cell escape from immune
              surveillance (e.g., by macrophages or neutrophils). Published
              studies demonstrated that anti-CD47 antibodies induced
              phagocytosis or apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and mediated
              in vivo anti-tumor efficacy Hypothesizing that blocking the
              CD47-SIRP$\alpha$ interaction will lead to phagocytosis and
              elimination of tumor cells, we generated 23 unique anti-CD47
              monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which potently block the
              CD47-SIRP$\alpha$ interaction. Upon further functional testing
              and optimization, three candidates emerged with nanomolar
              affinity to human and cynomolgus monkey CD47 and lack of
              hemagglutination and platelet aggregation activity: C47B157,
              C47B161 and C47B222 (human CD47 KD 3.53, 2.87, and 1.12 nM,
              respectively). To further characterize these antibodies and to
              better understand the contribution of merely blocking the
              CD47-SIRP$\alpha$ interaction to in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor
              activity, the mAbs were cloned into an effector function silent
              (IgG2sigma) and competent (IgG1) Fc backbone. In vitro ADCP
              assays demonstrated that IgG1 C47B157, C47B161, and C47B222
              enhanced phagocytosis 4-fold over PBS control, while the
              IgG2sigma mAbs did not enhance phagocytosis. Subsequently, the
              anti-tumor activity was characterized in three human acute
              myeloid leukemia (AML) xenograft models (HL60/NSG, MV4-11/NSG,
              and Kasumi-3/NSG mice). At 10mg/kg C47B157, C47B161, and C47B222
              completely suppressed growth of leukemia cells across all models
              in peripheral blood as IgG1 (0.74-2.78\%) vs. control
              (23.2-88.5\%) at time of control sacrifice. As IgG2sigma, C47B222
              caused greatest suppression at 10 mg/kg in all models
              (1.6-2.2\%). Additional in vivo studies with either AML cell
              lines or AML patient-derived primary cells revealed that although
              IgG2sigma C47B222 reduced disease outgrowth in peripheral blood
              and distinct organs (e.g., spleen), merely blocking the
              CD47-SIRP$\alpha$ interaction did not yield a survival advantage.
              In non-human primates, a single dose of IgG1 C47B222 caused ∼40\%
              decrease in red blood cell count, hematocrit and hemoglobin at 1
              mg/kg. In contrast, IgG2sigma C47B222 had minimal impact on red
              cell indices at 1 and 10 mg/kg In conclusion, the findings
              suggest that efficacy and tolerability of anti-CD47 mAbs are Fc
              effector function dependent. The need to balance efficacy and
              tolerability raise questions on the feasibility of targeting CD47

              can be complicated by neurologic adverse events (AE) in patients
              with refractory B-cell malignancies. In 133 adults treated with
              CD19 CAR-T cells, we found that acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
              high CD19+ cells in bone marrow, high CAR-T cell dose, cytokine
              release syndrome, and preexisting neurologic comorbidities were
              associated with increased risk of neurologic AEs. Patients with
              severe neurotoxicity demonstrated evidence of endothelial
              activation, including disseminated intravascular coagulation,
              capillary leak, and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB)
              permeability. The permeable BBB failed to protect the
              cerebrospinal fluid from high concentrations of systemic
              cytokines, including IFN$\gamma$, which induced brain vascular
              pericyte stress and their secretion of endothelium-activating

              disruption were found in the brain of a patient with fatal
              neurotoxicity. Biomarkers of endothelial activation were higher
              before treatment in patients who subsequently developed grade

              clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characterization of
              neurotoxicity after CD19 CAR-T cells, and identify risk factors
              for neurotoxicity. We show endothelial dysfunction and increased

              evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of granulocyte
              colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) priming and a dose
              intensification of Ara-C in RI chemotherapy for AML. Methods: A
              total of 29 patients with newly diagnosed AML received
              G-CSF-priming RI chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin (12 mg/m2,
              days 1-3), G-CSF (150 $\mu$g/m2, days 3-8) and Ara-C (500 mg/m2,
              b.i.d., days 4-8), and the outcomes were compared with those of a
              historical group treated with a standard regimen consisting of
              idarubicin (12 mg/m2, days 1-3) and Ara-C (100 mg/m2, days 1-7).
              Results: There was no difference in sex, age, subtype and
              cytogenetic risk between the two groups. The complete remission
              rate and treatment-related mortality were 72 and 17\% for the
              G-CSF-primed group (p = 0.89) and 71 and 10\% for the historical
              group (p = 0.32), respectively. The time to neutrophil recovery
              (25 vs. 24 days, p = 0.17) and platelet recovery (24 vs. 23 days,
              p = 0.23) did not differ significantly between the two groups.
              Similarly, the duration of fever was not significantly different
              (5 vs. 7 days, p = 0.58). Thirteen patients (45\%) experienced
              fever and 5 patients (17\%) manifested skin rashes during the
              G-CSF priming. After a median follow-up of 336 days, the 1-year
              overall survival, disease-free survival and event-free survival
              rates were 72 vs. 63\% (p = 0.83), 74 vs. 56\% (p = 0.059) and 53
              vs. 38\% (p = 0.32), respectively. Conclusion: The sensitization
              of leukemic cells with growth factors and dose intensification
              seem to be clinically applicable means to enhance the efficacy of
              RI chemotherapy only in selected patients with AML, thereby

              separate small from large thrombocytes for functional studies.
              When small and large thrombocytes were activated with ADP,
              collagen or thrombin receptor-activating peptide-6 (TRAP-6), we
              found that small platelets were more capable to aggregate than
              larger ones. In addition, platelet-released supernatants of small
              and large thrombin activated platelets were equally capable to
              activate human bone marrow stromal cells and human dental pulp
              fibroblasts to proliferate in an ex vivo assay. Finally,
              platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) generated from ionomycin
              stimulated small thrombocytes were more capable to activate the
              human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 to produce IL-8.
              Our results demonstrate CCE as a useful tool to separate
              thrombocytes by size in order to study their functional

              of mice carrying advance leukemia (day 6 following inoculation
              with 10(6) cells i.p.) with 6-azauridine (AzUR) results in

              with pyrazofurin (PF), another inhibitor of orotidylate
              decarboxylase and of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, fails to
              produce either of these effects. Neither AzUR or PF, given at the
              early stage of tumor growth (day 3), extend the life span nor do
              they cause increase of the PA activity. Thus, the elevation in PA
              activity following treatment with AzUR is associated with the
              asymptotic stage of the disease and this phenomenon correlates
              positively with the life-prolonging effects of this drug. An
              analysis of the PA activity elicited by intact cells, secretions,
              and cellular digests suggests that most of the activity

              the described in vivo effect of AzUR, but not that of PF, on
              late-stage leukemia, is mediated by the changes in the
              fibrinolytic potential of the tumor or host cells rather than
              through the inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis.",

              regimens, complete response (CR) and long-term survival rates in
              adults are 80-90 and 30-40\%, respectively. Currently, combined
              chemotherapy regimens, such as Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA, are used
              in patients with adult ALL. However, there has been no study
              comparing the results of Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA ALL-93. METHODS:
              In this retrospective single-center study, we evaluated the
              results of Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA ALL-93 in 51 ALL patients
              treated between September 2008 and March 2017 at the Department
              of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical
              University. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were treated with
              Hyper-CVAD and 13 with PETHEMA ALL-93. CR was obtained in 90 and
              100\% of patients, respectively. Survival estimates were
              comparable between Hyper-CVAD and PE-THEMA ALL-93, with a median
              overall survival (OS) and a median disease-free survival (DFS) of
              17.5 and 12.1 months, respectively, for Hyper-CVAD and of 18.6
              and 12.9 months, respectively, for PETHEMA ALL-93. The 2-year OS
              rates for Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA ALL-93 were 30 and 40\%,
              respectively, and the 2-year DFS rates were 28 and 44\%,
              respectively. PETHEMA ALL-93 resulted in more hepatotoxicity,
              hypofibrinogenemia, aspergillus infection, and skin rash than
              Hyper-CVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Although Hyper-CVAD and PE-THEMA ALL-93
              showed similar effects, Hyper-CVAD was tolerated better. Age and

              generation (T/P-G) assays have been recently described, and we
              have adapted the technique to investigate the interplay between
              coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with various haemostatic
              disorders. Our modified T/P-G was initiated by the addition of a
              mixture of optimised lower concentrations of tissue factor and
              tissue-type plasminogen activator. Thrombin generation (TG) and
              plasmin generation (PG) were monitored simultaneously using
              individual fluorescent substrates in separate microtitre wells.
              The relationship between coagulation and fibrinolysis was
              demonstrated by analysing the effects of thrombin inhibitors,
              activated protein C and thrombomodulin. The most evident
              impairments in TG were observed with plasma samples deficient of
              coagulation factors participating in the prothrombinase complex.
              Defects in PG were observed with deficiencies of factor (F)V, FX,
              fibrinogen, and plasminogen. TG appeared to be a prerequisite for
              the initiation of PG, and overall PG was governed by fibrinogen
              concentration. TG in patients with haemophilia A correlated with
              levels of FVIII activity, but there was no significant

              that global haemostasis depends on a sensitive balance between
              coagulation and fibrinolysis, and that the modified T/P-G assay
              could provide an enhanced understanding of haemorrhage and

              (crisantaspase); in a third preparation, colaspase is pegylated.
              Depletion of asparagine leads to decreased synthesis of
              procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic proteins, with
              resultant hypercoagulability and greater risk of venous
              thromboembolism (VTE). Colaspase and crisantaspase are not
              dose-equivalent, with crisantaspase displaying haemostatic
              toxicity only at dosages much higher and administered more
              frequently than those of colaspase. Cerebral venous thrombosis
              and pulmonary embolism are two life-endangering manifestations
              that occur during treatment with asparaginase particularly in
              children and in adults with ALL, respectively. Approximately
              one-third of VTEs are located in the upper extremities and are
              central venous line-related. Other risk factors are longer
              duration of asparaginase treatment and concomitant use of
              prednisone, anthracyclines, and oral contraceptives. The risk
              associated with inherited thrombophilia is uncertain but is
              clearly enhanced by other risk factors or by the use of
              prednisone. VTE prevention with fresh frozen plasma is not

              postmarketing safety reports recorded in the CSL Behring

              literature review of clinical studies published during the same

              of fibrinogen concentrate were distributed over the
              pharmacovigilance period, corresponding to 652,824 standard doses
              of 4 g each, across a range of clinical settings and indications.
              A total of 383 ADRs in 106 cases were reported (approximately 1
              per 24,600 g or 6,200 standard doses). Events of special interest
              included possible hypersensitivity reactions in 20 cases (1 per

              granules in resting platelets. In polarised cells it is localised

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by
              widening of the aorta. Once the aneurysm exceeds 5.5 cm, there is
              a 10\% risk of death due to rupture. AAA is also associated with
              mortality due to other cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to
              investigate clot structure in AAA and its relationship to
              aneurysm size. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma was obtained from 49
              controls, 40 patients with small AAA, and 42 patients with large
              AAA. Clot formation was studied by turbidity, fibrin pore
              structure by permeation, and time to half lysis by turbidity with
              tissue plasminogen activator. Plasma clot pore size showed a
              stepwise reduction from controls to small to large AAA. Lag phase
              for plasma clot formation and time to half lysis were prolonged,
              with smaller AAA samples showing intermediate response. Clot
              structure was normal in clots made with fibrinogen purified from
              patients compared with controls, suggesting a role for other
              plasma factors. Endogenous thrombin potential and turbidity using
              tissue factor indicated that the effects were independent of
              changes in thrombin generation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AAA
              form denser, smaller pored plasma clots that are more resistant
              to fibrinolysis, and these characteristics correlate with
              aneurysm size. Clot structure may play a role in AAA development
              and concomitant cardiovascular disease.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is characterized by systemic activation of
              inflammation and coagulation in response to infection. In sepsis,
              activated neutrophils extrude neutrophil extracellular traps
              composed of cell-free DNA (CFDNA) that not only trap pathogens
              but also provide a stimulus for clot formation. Although the
              effect of CFDNA on coagulation has been extensively studied, much
              less is known about the impact of CFDNA on fibrinolysis. To
              address this, we (1) investigated the relationship between CFDNA
              levels and fibrinolytic activity in sepsis and (2) determined the
              mechanisms by which CFDNA modulates fibrinolysis. APPROACH AND
              RESULTS: Plasma was collected from healthy and septic
              individuals, and CFDNA was quantified. Clot lysis assays were
              performed in plasma and purified systems, and lysis times were
              determined by monitoring absorbance. Clot morphology was assessed
              using scanning electron microscopy. Clots formed in plasma from
              septic patients containing >5 µg/mL CFDNA were dense in structure
              and resistant to fibrinolysis, a phenomenon overcome by
              deoxyribonuclease addition. These effects were recapitulated in
              control plasma supplemented with CFDNA. In a purified system,
              CFDNA delayed fibrinolysis but did not alter tissue-type
              plasminogen activator-induced plasmin generation. Using surface
              plasmon resonance, CFDNA bound plasmin with a Kd value of
              4.2$\pm$0.3 µmol/L, and increasing concentrations of CFDNA
              impaired plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin clots via the
              formation of a nonproductive ternary complex between plasmin,
              CFDNA, and fibrin. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that the
              increased levels of CFDNA in sepsis impair fibrinolysis by
              inhibiting plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation, thereby
              identifying CFDNA as a potential therapeutic target for sepsis

  abstract = "Recent studies have demonstrated a role of neutrophils in both
              venous and arterial thrombosis. A key prothrombotic feature of
              neutrophils is their ability to release web-like structures
              composed of DNA filaments coated with histones and granule
              proteins referred to as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).
              NETs were discovered over a decade ago as part of our first line
              of host defense against invading microorganisms. Although NETs
              have a protective role against pathogens, recent data suggest
              that an uncontrolled and excessive NET formation within the
              vasculature may contribute to pathological thrombotic disorders.
              In vitro studies suggest that NETs promote vessel occlusion by
              providing a scaffold for platelets, red blood cells,
              extracellular vesicles, and procoagulant molecules, such as von
              Willebrand factor and tissue factor. In addition, NET components
              enhance coagulation by both activating the intrinsic pathway and
              degrading an inhibitor of the extrinsic pathway (tissue factor
              pathway inhibitor). NET formation has, therefore, been proposed
              to contribute to thrombus formation and propagation in arterial,
              venous, and cancer-associated thrombosis. This review will
              describe animal and human studies suggesting a role of NETs in
              the pathogenesis of various thrombotic disorders. Targeting NETs

              meta-analysis of published observational studies. METHODS AND
              RESULTS: A systematic search of electronic databases (Medline,
              EMBASE, OVID, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library) for studies
              published from 1970 to 2007 was conducted using key words in

              independently screened by 2 authors, and those meeting the
              inclusion criteria defined a priori were retained. Data on year
              of publication, study design, country of origin, number of
              patients/controls, ethnicity, VTE type, and frequency of
              recurrence were abstracted. Heterogeneity across studies was
              evaluated, and summary odds ratios and 95\% CIs were calculated
              with both fixed-effects and random-effects models. Thirty-five of
              50 studies met inclusion criteria. No significant heterogeneity
              was discerned across studies. Although >70\% of patients had at
              least 1 clinical risk factor for VTE, a statistically significant
              association with VTE onset was demonstrated for each IT trait
              evaluated (and for combined IT traits), with summary odds ratios
              ranging from 2.63 (95\% CI, 1.61 to 4.29) for the factor II
              variant to 9.44 (95\% CI, 3.34 to 26.66) for antithrombin

              VTE was found for all IT traits except the factor V variant and

              indicates that detection of IT is clinically meaningful in
              children with, or at risk for, VTE and underscores the importance

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Major hyperferritinemia is a rare feature in
              clinical laboratories associated with a wide variety of
              disorders, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
              The diagnosis of HLH is based on clinical and biological
              criteria, such as those proposed by the Histiocyte Society.
              However, several of these criteria are not relevant in the
              specific setting of hematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: A 69-year-old male was treated for an acute myeloid
              leukaemia. On day 15 after the start of chemotherapy, he
              developed severe sepsis with high fever, low blood pressure and
              hepatosplenomegaly. RESULTS: Blood tests were marked by extreme
              hyperferritinemia (191,000 µg/L, reference range: 26-388 µg/L)
              with increased C-reactive protein (87.0 mg/L) and procalcitonin
              (1.94 µg/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (499 U/L 37 °C) in the
              setting of chemotherapy-induced aplasia. This unusual extreme
              ferritinemia led to suspect HLH triggered by an invasive
              infection. Under intensive treatment, the clinical status
              improved and ferritin levels significantly decreased.
              CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of HLH is usually based on clinical
              and biological criteria, mainly fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias,
              hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis and
              hyperferritinemia. In this patient, the diagnosis of HLH was
              challenging because several criteria, such as
              hypertriglyceridemia, hemophagocytosis and hypofibrinogenemia,
              were absent. In addition, some criteria of HLH are not relevant
              in the setting of hematologic malignancy, in which fever,
              splenomegaly, cytopenias and elevated lactate dehydrogenase are
              commonly observed independently of HLH. This unusual case of
              extremely high ferritinemia emphasizes the important weight of
              the ferritin level for the diagnosis of HLH in adult patients in
              the setting of hematologic malignancies.",

              the coagulation cascade, thereby giving no information on
              important interactions essential to the clinical evaluation of
              hemostatic function. Thromboelastography (TEG), originally
              described in 1948 has improved over the decades and become a
              valuable tool of coagulation testing because of the limitations
              of standard coagulation tests. TEG is a technique that provides
              data about the entire coagulation system, from the beginning of
              clot formation to fibrinolysis, involving both cellular and
              plasma components of hemostasis. Rotational thromboelastometry
              (ROTEM) which evolved from TEG technology overcome several
              limitations of classical TEG while maintaining a good correlation

              with APL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 31 newly-diagnosed APL patients
              (median age of 40 years; 14 female/17 male) that underwent
              treatment at the Clinic of Hematology UCCS from 2016-2020 with

              and ROTEM parameters obtained before treatment initiation were
              evaluated. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated at least one ROTEM
              parameter out of the reference range. ROTEM parameters associated
              with significant hemorrhage were EXTEM clotting time (CT) (P =

              EXTEM CT (P = 0.036) was associated with HED. Among CBCs and

              hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and
              pancytopenia. Three publications reported success with
              ruxolitinib, a Janus-associated kinase (JAK1/2) inhibitor. This
              therapy interrupts the production of cytokines associated with
              hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, namely interferon-$\gamma$
              and interleukins 2, 6, and 10. CASE REPORT: We administered
              ruxolitinib to two patients with lymphoma-associated
              hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis who had failed standard
              treatment with dexamethasone and etoposide. MANAGEMENT AND
              OUTCOME: Patient \#1 was started on ruxolitinib 10 mg BID, and
              titrated to 15 mg BID. All but two of the hemophagocytic
              lymphohistiocytosis criteria resolved within two weeks, and she
              was able to restart therapy for lymphoma. During her ruxolitinib
              taper, she again presented with relapsed hemophagocytic
              lymphohistiocytosis. She was taking 2.5 mg a day at the time.
              Despite salvage treatment, she died from the disease. Patient \#2
              was a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient who presented with
              hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and was treated with
              chemoimmunotherapy and achieved a complete response (CR).
              Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis symptoms relapsed, and he was
              treated with ruxolitinib. He developed relapsed lymphoma and
              unfortunately died. DISCUSSION: While treating the underlying
              lymphoma is a clear priority, the cytopenias and other symptoms
              of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis complicate the delivery of
              this therapy. Hence, the use of ruxolitinib as a bridge to
              definitive therapy was appealing. However, we are concerned about
              the progression of lymphoma while these patients were taking
              ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib may be controlling cytokine storm
              associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, while other
              aspects of the condition are progressing. Therefore, we would
              advise caution in its use in lymphoma-associated-hemophagocytic
              lymphohistiocytosis until more data are available.",

              composed of a Ras exchange motif (REM) and a CDC25 domain.
              RasGRPs also possess a pair of atypical EF hands that may bind
              calcium in vivo and a C1 domain resembling the diacylglycerol
              (DAG)-binding domain of protein kinase C. DAG directly activates
              RasGRPs by a membrane recruitment mechanism as well as indirectly
              by PKC-mediated phosphorylation. RasGRPs are prominently
              expressed in blood cells. RasGRP1 acts downstream of TCR, while
              RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 both act downstream of BCR. Together, they

               important for disease progression. Today they play a crucial
               role in the treatment of multiple myeloma patients, and have
               considerably improved myeloma outcomes. These agents, and

              infancy. Besides vasculopathy, thrombophilia, or cardiac
              disorders, cancer and chemotherapy are known predisposing factors
              for AIS. Leukemia can be associated with different abnormal
              coagulation parameters, but severe bleeding or thrombosis occurs
              rarely. Clinical Course: We report the case of a 2-year-old boy
              who was presented to our emergency ward after a prolonged seizure
              with right sided postictal hemiparesis. Cranial computed
              tomography scan revealed a large infarction and edema due to
              thrombosis of the left carotid artery, the middle cerebral
              artery, and the anterior cerebral artery. Laboratory workup
              showed 196 g/L leukocytes with 75\% myeloid blast cells.
              Immediate exchange transfusion, hydration, and chemotherapy with
              cytarabine were started. During the hospital course intracranial
              pressure increased and the patient developed a unilateral dilated
              pupil unresponsive to light. Cranial computed tomography scan
              revealed a new infarction in the right middle cerebral artery
              territory. Refractory increased intracranial pressure and brain
              stem herniation developed, and the child died 3 days after
              admission to hospital. Conclusion: Seizures with postictal
              hemiparesis due to cerebral infarction can be a rare
              manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Leukocytosis and
              cancer-induced coagulopathy are main reasons for thrombosis
              and/or hemorrhage. High leukocyte counts need immediate
              interventions with hydration, careful chemotherapy, and perhaps
              exchange transfusion or leukapharesis. In the presence of
              thrombosis, anticoagulation must be discussed despite the risk of
              bleeding due to hyperfibrinolysis and low platelet counts.

              Thrombomodulin (TM), plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex (PAP),
              plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and thrombin activable

              resulted in a marked decrease in TM, PAI-1, PAP and TAFIa levels.
              These findings suggested that the changes in antifibrinolytic

              infections are major determinants for clotting activation in

              manifestations range from localized venous or arterial thrombosis
              to a diffuse, life-threatening thrombohemorrhagic syndrome (THS).
              All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has greatly improved the

              patients, which is reflected by specific parameters such as an
              increased thrombin generation and elevated D-dimer levels. Blood
              cells, especially WBCs and platelets, play an important role in
              this activation process. Neutrophils and monocytes are
              subpopulations of WBCs that increase the thrombotic potential by
              different mechanisms. Neutrophils are activated by tumor cells
              and can release DNA, generating highly thrombogenic neutrophil
              extracellular traps. Monocytes are able to synthesize and express
              significant quantities of procoagulant tissue factor on their
              surfaces upon activation. An increased risk of VTE has been found
              in patients with solid tumors and elevated platelet count and in

              tissue factor-induced and tissue-type plasminogen activator

              in control subjects as cut-off levels, we found a dose-dependent
              increase in risk for DVT in patients with hypofibrinolysis (odds
              ratios of 1.4, 1.6, 1.9, 2.1, and 2.2, respectively). This
              indicates a 2-fold increased risk of DVT in subjects with clot
              lysis times above the 90th percentile. The risk increase was not
              affected by age or sex (adjusted odds ratio for 90th percentile,

              allele-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
              (RT-PCR). Thrombopoietin (TPO) binds to the Mpl receptor and is
              the major regulator of megakaryopoiesis. To explore the
              mechanisms underlying thrombocytopenia, we studied the TPO/Mpl

              sequence analysis, low MPL mRNA levels were found, suggesting
              decreased gene expression. Of particular interest, several
              AML1-binding motifs are present in the MPL promoter, suggesting
              MPL is an AML1 target. In conclusion, we identified a C-terminal

  abstract = "The last 2 years have seen much excitement in the field of
              genetics with the identification of a formerly unappreciated
              level of ``structural variation'' within the normal human genome.
              Genetic structural variants include deletions, duplications, and
              inversions in addition to the recently discovered, copy number
              variants. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are the most
              extensively evaluated variant within the genome to date.
              Combining our knowledge from these studies with our rapidly
              accumulating understanding of structural variants, it is apparent
              that the extent of genetic dissimilarity between any 2
              individuals is considerable and much greater than that which was
              previously recognized. Clearly, this more diverse view of the
              genome has significant implications for allogeneic hematopoietic

              transplant antigens but also in terms of individual

              detailed genetic analysis of patient and donor prior to

              penetrance, usually of late onset, and typically presents with
              nephropathy leading to renal failure. Amyloid deposits often
              develop rapidly in transplanted kidneys, and concomitant
              orthotopic liver transplantation has lately been performed in
              several patients with the hope of halting amyloid deposition.
              Fibrinogen is produced in vitro by hepatocytes but also by other
              human cell types, and although the liver is the source of plasma
              fibrinogen in vivo in rats, this is not known in humans.
              Transplantation of livers expressing wild-type fibrinogen into
              patients with variant fibrinogen amyloidosis provides a unique
              opportunity to establish the source of human plasma fibrinogen.
              We therefore characterized plasma fibrinogen Aalpha-chain
              allotypes by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry mapping of
              tryptic digests before and after liver transplantation. Before
              liver transplantation, fibrinogen amyloidosis patients with the

              proportions of peptide with the wild-type sequence
              TFPGFFSPMLGEFVSETESR, and with the amyloidogenic variant sequence
              TFPGFFSPMLGEFVSVTESR, as expected for individuals heterozygous
              for the mutation. After transplantation, only the wild-type

              (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The disorder, caused
              by inherited mutations in RUNX1, is uncommon with only 14
              pedigrees reported. We screened 10 families with a history of
              more than one first degree relative with MDS/AML for inherited
              mutations in RUNX1. Germline RUNX1 mutations were identified in 5
              pedigrees with a 3:2 predominance of N-terminal mutations.
              Several affected members had normal platelet counts or platelet
              function, features not previously reported in FPD/AML. The median
              incidence of MDS/AML among carriers of RUNX1 mutation was 35\%.

              ($\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation signals) from protease-activated

              $\alpha$-actinin from $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. We evaluated the
              time-dependent changes of the $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation
              state by measuring PAC-1 binding velocity. The initial velocity
              analysis clearly showed that PAR1-activating peptide stimulation

              PAR4-activating peptide induced long-lasting $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3

              $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 was only transient in PAR4-stimulated
              P2Y(12)-deficient platelets in which the sustained

              Overexpression of wild-type $\alpha$-actinin, but not the mutant

              (PML-RAR-$\alpha$) oncoprotein. It is characterized by severe
              hemorrhagic complications due in part to excessive fibrinolysis,
              resulting from the excessive generation of the fibrinolytic
              enzyme, plasmin, at the cell surface of the PML cells. The
              treatment of patients with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
              effectively ameliorates the disease by promoting the destruction
              of the PML-RAR-$\alpha$ oncoprotein. In the present study we show
              for the first time that the plasminogen receptor, S100A10, is
              present on the extracellular surface of APL cells and is rapidly

              degranulation, integrin $\alpha$(IIb)$\beta$3 activation,
              phosphatidylserine exposure, aggregation, and in vitro thrombus
              formation were significantly impaired in sgk1(-/-) platelets,
              whereas tail bleeding time was not significantly enhanced.
              Platelet and megakaryocyte Orai1 transcript levels and membrane
              protein abundance were significantly reduced in sgk1(-/-) mice.
              In human megakaryoblastic cells (MEG-01), transfection with

              (K127N)SGK1 significantly enhanced Orai1 expression and SOCE,
              while effects reversed by the SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 (1$\mu$M).
              Transfection of MEG-01 cells with (S422D)SGK1 significantly
              increased phosphorylation of I$\kappa$B kinase $\alpha$/$\beta$

              decisions that ultimately lead to the production of polyploid
              megakaryocytes. On average, megakaryocytes release 1011 platelets
              per day into the blood that repair vascular injuries and prevent

              induction and consolidation. Induction consists of
              high-dose-methotrexate-based polychemotherapy for most patients,
              with regimen and dose variations according to patient
              characteristics and country. Several strategies have been
              proposed for the consolidation phase, with whole-brain
              irradiation (WBRT) the most common. However, some authorities
              recommend avoiding WBRT because of its related risk of severe
              neurotoxicity. The most relevant alternatives to WBRT are
              high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell
              transplantation (HDC/ASCT) or non-myeloablative chemotherapy, the
              former supported by several single-arm phase II trials. Moreover,
              HDC/ASCT is the only strategy that is assessed in comparison with
              WBRT in ongoing randomized trials. The rationale for the use of
              HDC/ASCT in PCNSL patients is based on the fact that the delivery
              of high doses could achieve therapeutic drug concentrations in
              the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, and that non-cross resistant
              drugs used for conditioning (e.g. alkylating agents) could favour
              the elimination of residual chemoresistant lymphoma cells.
              Worldwide experience with HDC/ASCT is limited to few single-arm
              phase II trials, but overall results are encouraging, mostly when
              thiotepa/containing conditioning regimens are used, both in
              newly-diagnosed and relapsed patients. However, several questions

              candidates for this strategy, the optimal conditioning regimen,
              the best time for response assessment, and acute and late effects
              remain unanswered. In this review, we critically analyze reported
              studies on HDC/ASCT in PCNSL, and discuss its current role and
              future perspectives in treating this aggressive malignancy.",

              days and 10.4\% (4.4\% venous, 5.9\% arterial) in elderly

              cohort of elderly AML patients (HR 11.08 (3.23-38.06)). Among all

              consequences of hyperfibrinolysis remain largely unknown. Our aim
              was to develop an experimental model of hyperfibrinolysis and to
              study its effects on the homeostasis of the blood-brain barrier
              (BBB). We induced a sustained hyperfibrinolytic state in mice by
              hydrodynamic transfection of a plasmid encoding for tissue-type
              plasminogen activator (tPA). As revealed by near-infrared
              fluorescence imaging, hyperfibrinolytic mice presented a
              significant increase in BBB permeability. Using a set of deletion
              variants of tPA and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrated
              that this effect was independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate

              protease-activated receptor-1, or matrix metalloproteinases. In

              leakage is dependent on plasmin-mediated generation of bradykinin
              and subsequent activation of bradykinin B2 receptors.
              Accordingly, this effect was prevented by icatibant, a clinically
              available B2 receptor antagonist. In agreement with these
              preclinical data, bradykinin generation was also observed in
              humans in a context of acute pharmacological hyperfibrinolysis.
              Altogether, these results suggest that B2 receptor blockade may
              be a promising strategy to prevent the deleterious effects of
              hyperfibrinolysis on the homeostasis of the BBB.",

              leukemia (APL) with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), early death
              because of hemorrhage remains unacceptably common, and the
              mechanism underlying this complication remains elusive. We have
              recently demonstrated that APL cells undergo a novel cell death
              program, termed ETosis, which involves release of extracellular
              chromatin. However, the role of promyelocytic extracellular
              chromatin in APL-associated coagulation remains unclear. Our
              objectives were to identify the novel role of ATRA-promoted
              extracellular chromatin in inducing a hypercoagulable and
              hyperfibrinolytic state in APL and to evaluate its interaction
              with fibrin and endothelial cells (ECs). Results from a series of
              coagulation assays have shown that promyelocytic extracellular
              chromatin increases thrombin and plasmin generation, causes a
              shortening of plasma clotting time of APL cells, and increases
              fibrin formation. DNase I but not anti-tissue factor antibody
              could inhibit these effects. Immunofluorescence staining showed
              that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin and phosphatidylserine
              on APL cells provide platforms for fibrin deposition and render
              clots more resistant to fibrinolysis. Additionally, coincubation
              assays revealed that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin is
              cytotoxic to ECs, converting them to a procoagulant phenotype.
              This cytotoxity was blocked by DNase I by 20\% or activated
              protein C by 31\%. Our current results thus delineate the
              pathogenic role of promyelocytic extracellular chromatin in APL
              coagulopathy. Furthermore, the remaining coagulation disturbance
              in high-risk APL patients after ATRA administration may be
              treatable by intrinsic pathway inhibition via accelerating
              extracellular chromatin degradation.",

               transfusion therapy for severe thrombocytopenia in patients
               undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancy, WHO Grade 2 or
               greater bleeding continues to occur at rates of 43\% to 70\%.
               Although antifibrinolytic therapy has been shown to reduce
               bleeding and transfusion needs in patients with inherited
               bleeding disorders and in multiple surgical settings, evidence
               in therapy-induced thrombocytopenia in hematologic malignancy is
               lacking. The American Trial Using Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in
               Thrombocytopenia (A-TREAT) evaluated the effects of prophylactic
               TXA as an adjunct to routine transfusion therapy on bleeding and
               transfusion requirements in a multicenter, double blind placebo
               controlled randomized clinical trial in patients undergoing
               treatment for hematologic malignancy. Methods: Adult patients at
               3 US academic medical centers with hematologic malignancy
               undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell
               transplantation (HSCT) anticipated to have hypoproliferative
               thrombocytopenia were enrolled between June 15, 2016 and
               February 4, 2020. Randomization was stratified by site and
               therapeutic group: Chemotherapy, Allogeneic transplant, or
               Autologous transplant. Patients received study drug
               intravenously (1,000mg TXA or saline) or orally (1300mg TXA or
               placebo) every 8 hours beginning when the plt count was
               $\leq$30,000/µL and continued until platelet count recovery
               >30,000/ul or if a diagnosis of thrombosis was made. Patients
               were transfused prophylactically for counts of $\leq$10,000/µL
               or if indicated in the judgement of the treating physician.
               Daily assessments for bleeding were made by trained research
               staff (inpatients) or by self-assessment in a patient diary
               (outpatients), and by patient interview and chart review. The
               primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with bleeding of
               WHO grade 2 or above over 30 days after activation of study
               drug. A score test based on logistic regression was used,
               adjusted for study site and therapeutic group and adjusted for
               sequential monitoring. Multiple imputations were used to account
               for missing data. Secondary endpoints were number of
               transfusions and number of days alive without WHO grade 2+
               bleeding during the first 30 days post activation of study drug.
               Results: 3,788 patients were screened and 360 patients
               consented. 330 patients were activated and evaluable; 327
               received at least one dose of study drug. The adjusted odds
               ratio of grade 2+ bleeding was 0.86 (95\% CI: 0.52, 1.38;
               p-value=0.74). The difference in mean number of transfusions was
               0.1 (95\% CI: -1.9, 2.0; p-value=0.94), while the average
               difference in days alive without grade 2+ bleeding was 0.1 (95\%
               CI: -1.4, 1.5; p-value=0.94). No differences in exploratory
               outcomes were observed. The mean difference in transfusions per
               thrombocytopenic day was -0.02 (95\% CI: -0.09, 0.04;
               p-value=0.51). The mean difference in RBC transfusions per
               thrombocytopenic day was 0.03 (95\% CI: -0.05, 0.11;
               p-value=0.43). The average number of days with thrombocytopenia
               or bleeding was similar across treatment arms (9.2 [SD=6.7] TXA
               vs. 9.1 [6.2] placebo). The hazard ratio of time to grade 2+
               bleeding or death was 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.43, 2.16; p-value=0.92).
               The mean difference in highest grade of bleeding was -0.1 (95\%
               CI: -0.2, 0.1; p-value=0.42). There were no deaths due to
               bleeding. VOD was observed in 3/164 TXA subjects (1.8\%) and
               2/163 (1.2\%) placebo subjects. An increase in the incidence of
               central venous line occlusions and the use of tissue plasminogen
               activator was noted in the TXA arm. (11.0\% vs. 19.5\% and
               25.8\% vs. 42.1\% for placebo and TXA groups, respectively).
               Recurrent line occlusion led to permanent discontinuation of
               drug in 4.9\% of TXA and 1.8\% of placebo subjects. No increase
               in any other non-catheter thrombotic events was noted. No
               patient died from a thrombotic event in 120 days following
               activation of study drug. Conclusions: Prophylactic TXA has no
               effect on the incidence of WHO Grade 2+ bleeding when given in
               addition to routine plt transfusions to severely
               thrombocytopenic patients undergoing therapy for hematologic
               malignancy. An increased incidence of line occlusion in the TXA
               arm was observed but no increase in other types of thrombotic
               events was detected. Disclosures Gernsheimer: Rigel Corporation:

              L-asparaginase (L-ASP). Antithrombin (AT) replacement has been
              suggested to prevent VTE and thus might increase exposure to ASP.
              We report herein the results of the prophylactic replacement
              strategy in the pediatric-inspired prospective GRAALL-2005 study.
              Between 2006 and 2014, 784 adult patients with newly diagnosed
              Philadelphia-negative ALL were included. The incidence rate of
              VTE was 16\% with 69\% of them occurring during induction
              therapy. Most patients received AT supplementation (87\%). After
              excluding patients who did not receive L-ASP or developed
              thrombosis before L-ASP, AT supplementation did not have a
              significant impact on VTE (8\% versus 14\%, OR: 0.6, p=0.1).
              Fibrinogen concentrates administration was associated with an
              increased risk of VTE (17\% versus 9\%, OR 2.2, p=0.02) whereas
              transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma had no effect. Heparin
              prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of VTE (13\%
              versus 7\%, OR 1.9, p=0.04). Prophylactic measures were not
              associated with an increased risk of grade 3-4 bleeding
              complications. The rate of VTE recurrence after L-ASP
              reintroduction was 3\% (1/34). In ALL patients receiving L-ASP
              therapy, the use of fibrinogen concentrates may increase the risk
              of thrombosis and should be restricted to rare patients with
              hypofibrinogenemia-induced hemorrhage. Patients developed VTE
              despite extensive AT supplementation which advocates for
              additional prophylactic measures. While this large descriptive
              study was not powered to demonstrate the efficacy of these
              prophylactic measures, it provides important insight to guide
              future trial design. NCT00327678.",

              subset of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and on
              activated platelets and T cells. Although it has been suggested
              that T-cell CD109 may play a role in antibody-inducing T-helper
              function and it is known that platelet CD109 carries the Gov
              alloantigen system, the role of CD109 in hematopoietic cells
              remains largely unknown. As a first step toward elucidating the
              function of CD109, we have isolated and characterized a human
              CD109 cDNA from KG1a and endothelial cells. The isolated cDNA
              comprises a 4335 bp open-reading frame encoding a 1445 amino acid
              (aa) protein of approximately 162 kd that contains a 21 aa
              N-terminal leader peptide, 17 potential N-linked glycosylation
              sites, and a C-terminal GPI anchor cleavage-addition site. We
              report that CD109 is a novel member of the $\alpha$2
              macroglobulin ($\alpha$2M)C3, C4, C5 family of
              thioester-containing proteins, and we demonstrate that native
              CD109 does indeed contain an intact thioester. Analysis of the
              CD109 aa sequence suggests that CD109 is likely activated by
              proteolytic cleavage and thereby becomes capable of
              thioester-mediated covalent binding to adjacent molecules or
              cells. In addition, the predicted chemical reactivity of the
              activated CD109 thioester is complementlike rather than
              resembling that of $\alpha$2M proteins. Thus, not only is CD109
              potentially capable of covalent binding to carbohydrate and
              protein targets, but the t1/2 of its activated thioester is
              likely extremely short, indicating that CD109 action is highly
              restricted spatially to the site of its activation. \copyright{}

              the presence of single or combined-inherited and/or acquired
              causes of thrombophilia. A total of 301 patients aged neonate to
              18 years (median, 6 years) who were referred for an objectively
              confirmed first episode of spontaneous VTE were followed
              prospectively for a median time of 7 years (range, 6 months to 15
              years) after withdrawal of anticoagulation. All patients were
              studied for established acquired and inherited causes of
              thromboembolism. With reference to all 301 patients, one single
              prothrombotic risk factor was found in 176 subjects (58.5\%),
              whereas combined defects were found in 20.6\% (n = 62). Recurrent

              years (range, 7 weeks to 15 years) after withdrawal of

              genetic defects, gender, and acquired risk factors, multivariate

              also possess fibrinolytic activity. To determine whether
              thrombotic or fibrinolytic activity is a predominant
              characteristic of these extracellular vesicles, we prepared
              exosomes and MVs from 2 breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and
              MCF7), a lung cancer cell line (A549), and a leukemia cell line
              (NB4) and assayed their thrombotic and fibrinolytic activities.
              We observed that thrombotic activity was a common feature of MVs
              but not exosomes. Exosomes and/or MVs from several cell lines,
              with the exception of the A549 cell line, displayed fibrinolytic
              activity toward a pure fibrin clot, but only exosomes from
              MDA-MB-231 cells could degrade a fibrin clot formed in plasma.
              Increasing the malignant potential of MCF7 cells decreased the

              thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric patients in tertiary care
              settings, relatively few pediatric physicians have experience
              with antithrombotic interventions. OBJECTIVE: These guidelines of
              the American Society of Hematology (ASH), based on the best
              available evidence, are intended to support patients, clinicians,
              and other health care professionals in their decisions about
              management of pediatric VTE. METHODS: ASH formed a
              multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 2 patient
              representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from
              conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre
              supported the guideline-development process, including updating
              or performing systematic evidence reviews (up to April of 2017).
              The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according
              to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used
              the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and
              Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision
              frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which
              were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 30
              recommendations, covering symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein
              thrombosis, with specific focus on management of central venous
              access device-associated VTE. The panel also addressed renal and
              portal vein thrombosis, cerebral sino venous thrombosis, and
              homozygous protein C deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Although the panel
              offered many recommendations, additional research is required.
              Priorities include understanding the natural history of
              asymptomatic thrombosis, determining subgroup boundaries that
              enable risk stratification of children for escalation of
              treatment, and appropriate study of newer anticoagulant agents in

              thrombosis. PAI-1 is expressed by pancreatic tumors and human
              pancreatic cell lines. However, to date, there are no studies
              analyzing the association of active PAI-1 and VTE in pancreatic
              cancer patients. We investigated the association of active PAI-1

              determined if the presence of human pancreatic tumors expressing
              PAI-1 impairs venous thrombus resolution in mice. Plasma levels
              of active PAI-1 in patients with pancreatic cancer and mice
              bearing human tumors were determined by enzyme-linked
              immunosorbent assay. We measured PAI-1 expression in 5 different
              human pancreatic cancer cell lines and found that PANC-1 cells
              expressed the highest level. PANC-1 tumors were grown in nude

              Mice bearing PANC-1 tumors had increased levels of both active
              human and active mouse PAI-1 and decreased levels of plasmin
              activity. Importantly, mice bearing PANC-1 tumors exhibited
              impaired venous thrombus resolution 8 days after IVC stasis

              urokinase (u-PA) and D-dimers (D-D) were quantified in plasma
              samples and pleural effusion specimens. These data were then
              correlated with inflammatory or infectious parameters, i.e.
              fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), erythrocyte
              sedimentation rate (ESR), protein concentration, and white blood
              cell count. D-D levels were higher in pleural fluid than in
              plasma. D-D levels were not correlated with either plasminogen

              Bleeding Scale in two studies of eltrombopag in adults with
              chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND
              METHODS: Validated scales assessing bleeding in adults with ITP
              are lacking. Data from two long-term, phase 3 clinical trials
              (RAISE: NCT00370331; EXTEND: NCT00351468) that assessed
              eltrombopag in adults with chronic ITP were analyzed to evaluate
              the performance of the WHO Bleeding Scale. RESULTS: In RAISE,
              effect size (0.71), standardized response (0.75), and
              responsiveness statistics (0.57) were moderate for bleeding and
              bruising assessments. In EXTEND, effect size (0.62) and
              responsiveness statistics (0.59) were moderate; the standardized
              response statistic was 0.487. Intraclass correlation for
              test-retest reliability was 0.75 in RAISE and 0.71 in EXTEND. A
              positive correlation was observed between the WHO Bleeding Scale
              and the ITP Bleeding Scale. Bleeding scores and quality-of-life
              measures were inversely correlated (p < 0.05 for all). Minimal
              important differences for the WHO Bleeding Scale were 0.33-0.40
              at baseline and last on-treatment assessment in both studies.
              LIMITATIONS: The majority of bleeding in these studies was mild
              to moderate, so this analysis cannot provide strong evidence of
              the validity of the WHO Bleeding Scale in patients with more
              severe bleeding. Potential limitations to the WHO Bleeding Scale
              itself include dependence on clinician interpretation of patient
              recall, inability to distinguish among bleeding events occurring
              at different anatomical sites, and an inherent assumption of
              linear increases in severity of bleeding across the response
              categories. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest potential
              usefulness of the WHO Bleeding Scale in adult patients with
              chronic ITP for standardizing grading of bleeding across research
              studies and in clinical practice.",

              acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generally have poorer survival
              outcomes and less benefit from clinical trials. A recent phase 3
              trial demonstrated a trend toward improved overall survival (OS)
              with decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, compared with treatment
              choice of either cytarabine or supportive care (7.7 months, 95\%
              CI: 6.2-9.2 vs 5.0 months, 95\% CI: 4.3-6.3, respectively) in
              older adults with newly diagnosed AML. The current analyses
              investigated prognostic factors for outcomes in this trial and
              examined OS and responses in prespecified subgroups.Methods: A
              multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to
              investigate effects of demographic and baseline characteristics,
              including age, sex, cytogenetic risk, AML type, ECOG Performance
              Status, geographic region, bone marrow blasts, platelets, and
              white blood cells on OS, based on mature data. Similar analyses
              were conducted with a logistic regression model to predict
              response rates. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed for
              OS and response rates, also using mature data.Results: Patient
              characteristics that appeared to negatively influence OS included
              more advanced age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.560 for $\geq$75 vs 50\%
              vs $\leq$50\%; p = 0.0045), low baseline platelet counts (HR
              0.775 for each additional 100 $\times$ 109/L; p = 0.0015), and
              high white blood cell counts (HR 1.256 for each additional 25
              $\times$ 109/L; p = 0.0151). Regarding geographic regions,
              patients from Western Europe had the longest median OS. Response
              rates favored decitabine for all subgroups investigated,
              including patients $\geq$75 years (odds ratio 5.94, p =
              0.0006).Conclusion: Response to decitabine in AML is associated
              with known prognostic factors related to both patient
              demographics and disease characteristics.Trial registration:

              and P-selectin antibodies were used to bind the platelet-bound
              autoantibodies complex generated from plasma samples of 250 ITP
              patients, 163 non-ITP patients and 243 healthy controls, a

              signals were recorded by flow cytometry. Intra- and inter-assay

              Finally, treatment process was monitored by our quantitative FCIA
              in 8 newly diagnosed ITPs. RESULTS: The coefficient of variations
              (CV) of the quantitative FCIA assay were respectively 9.4, 3.8,

              diagnosed with HLH in our hospital from April 2005 to June 2014.
              RESULTS: Patients with HLH displayed variable clinical markers
              across a wide spectrum. These included fever and
              hyperferritinemia (100\%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Patients with haematological malignancies often
              develop thrombocytopenia as a consequence of either their disease
              or its treatment. Platelet transfusions are commonly given to
              raise a low platelet count and reduce the risk of clinical
              bleeding (prophylaxis) or stop active bleeding (therapy). Recent
              studies have shown that many patients continue to experience
              bleeding despite the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions.
              Tranexamic acid is an anti-fibrinolytic, which reduces the
              breakdown of clots formed in response to bleeding.
              Anti-fibrinolytics have been shown to prevent bleeding, decrease
              blood loss and use of red cell transfusions in elective and
              emergency surgery, and are used widely in these settings. The aim
              of this trial is to test whether giving tranexamic acid to
              patients receiving treatment for haematological malignancies
              reduces the risk of bleeding or death and the need for platelet
              transfusions. METHODS: This is a multinational randomised,
              double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, superiority trial.
              Patients will be randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid
              (given intravenously or orally) or a matching placebo in a 1:1
              ratio, stratified by site. Patients with haematological
              malignancies receiving intensive chemotherapy or stem cell
              transplantation (or both) who are at least 18 years of age and
              expected to become severely thrombocytopenic for at least 5 days
              will be eligible for this trial. The primary outcome of the trial
              is the proportion of patients who died or had bleeding of World
              Health Organization grade 2 or above during the first 30 days of
              the trial. We will measure the rates of bleeding daily by using a
              short, structured assessment of bleeding, and we will record the
              number of transfusions given to patients. We will assess the risk
              of arterial and venous thrombosis for 120 days from the start of
              trial treatment. DISCUSSION: This trial will assess the safety
              and efficacy of using prophylactic tranexamic acid during a
              period of intensive chemotherapy and associated thrombocytopenia
              in people with haematological disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This

  abstract = "Microparticles (MPs) are small membrane vesicles that are
              released from many different cell types by exocytic budding of
              the plasma membrane in response to cellular activation or
              apoptosis. MPs may also be involved in clinical diseases because
              they express phospholipids, which function as procoagulants.
              Although flow cytometry is the most widely used method for
              studying MPs, some novel assays, such as tissue factor-dependent
              procoagulant assay or the ELISA method, have been reported.
              However, the use of quantification of MP as a clinical tool is
              still controversial. Elevated platelet-derived MP, endothelial
              cell-derived MP, and monocyte-derived MP concentrations are
              documented in almost all thrombotic diseases occurring in venous
              and arterial beds. However, the significance of MPs in various
              clinical conditions remains controversial. An example of this
              controversy is that it is unknown if MPs found in peripheral
              blood vessels cause thrombosis or whether they are the result of
              thrombosis. Numerous studies have shown that not only the
              quantity, but also the cellular origin and composition of
              circulating MPs, are dependent on the type of disease, the
              disease state, and medical treatment. Additionally, many
              different functions have been attributed to MPs. Therefore, the
              number and type of clinical disorders associated with elevated
              MPs are currently increasing. However, MPs were initially thought
              to be small particles with procoagulant activity. Taken together,
              our review suggests that MPs may be a useful biomarker to
              identify thrombosis.",

              glycoengineered, type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
              obinutuzumab (Gazyva\textregistered{}) (GA101) plus chlorambucil
              (Leukeran\textregistered{}) was associated with superior outcomes
              to rituximab (Rituxan\textregistered{}) plus chlorambucil, with a
              similar safety profile. However, a higher occurrence of
              infusion-related reactions (IRRs) was reported with obinutuzumab.
              These reactions typically require additional management.
              OBJECTIVES: The focus of this article is to provide oncology
              nurses and physicians with advice for obinutuzumab IRR management
              based on clinical trial data and nursing experience. METHODS: The
              authors reviewed the published management strategies for IRRs
              with obinutuzumab that were identified during the phase III CLL11
              trial and an expanded access phase IIb study (ML28979). Practical
              advice for obinutuzumab IRR management was developed based on
              available clinical trial information and nursing experience.
              FINDINGS: IRRs with obinutuzumab are generally manageable. Most
              IRRs (all grades), and all grade 3-4 IRRs, occurred during the
              first infusion. Therefore, IRR management could be improved
              substantially with extra vigilance at this early stage.",

              PATIENTS AND METHODS: An electronic database search of patients
              with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic
              lymphoma (SLL) who presented at The University of Texas M.D.

              June 2005 was performed, and patient medical records were
              reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 3,986 patients with CLL/SLL, 204
              patients (5.1\%) had possible RS, and 148 patients (3.7\%) had
              biopsy- or fine-needle aspiration-proven RS. Treatment included
              chemotherapy alone and chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab. The
              overall response rate for the 130 assessable patients was 39\%
              (chemotherapy, 34\%; chemoimmunotherapy, 47\%; P = .2). In
              multivariate analysis, factors predicting prolonged survival were
              Zubrod performance status 0-1 (P = .006), lactate dehydrogenase
              or = 100,000 (P = .01), tumor size < or = 5 cm (P = .02), and
              fewer than two prior therapies (P = .02). The five adverse
              factors predicting shorter survival were used to design a model
              to predict an individual patient's risk of death: the RS score. A
              total of 20 patients underwent stem-cell transplantation (SCT).
              Patients who underwent allogeneic SCT as postremission therapy
              had longer survival than patients who achieved remission and
              received no additional therapy or patients who underwent
              allogeneic or autologous SCT as salvage therapy (P = .019).
              CONCLUSION: A score to predict an individual patient's risk of
              death is proposed. Chemotherapy and rituximab combinations are
              effective in RS. Patients with available donors may be considered

              patients with newly diagnosed cancer or progression of disease
              who did not recently receive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
              surgery were enrolled and followed for a median of 501 days
              (interquartile range, 255 to 731 days). The malignancies in these

              The study end point was occurrence of objectively confirmed
              symptomatic or fatal VTE. RESULTS: VTE occurred in 62 patients
              (7.6\%). The cutoff level for elevated D-dimer and elevated F 1 +

              elevated F 1 + 2, age, sex, surgery, chemotherapy, and
              radiotherapy, the hazard ratios (HRs) of VTE in patients with
              elevated D-dimer (HR, 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.0 to 3.2; P = .048) and
              elevated F 1 + 2 (HR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.6; P = .015) were
              statistically significantly increased. The cumulative probability
              of developing VTE after 6 months was highest in patients with
              both elevated D-dimer and elevated F 1 + 2 (15.2\%) compared with
              patients with nonelevated D-dimer and nonelevated F 1 + 2 (5.0\%;

              scheduled salvage regimen with transplantation, 15 remained on
              ABVD (physician's decision, mostly because of minimally positive
              PET2), five received an alternative treatment, and two were
              excluded because of diagnostic error. On intention-to-treat
              analysis, the 2-year progression-free survival was 76\% for
              PET2-positive patients (regardless of the salvage treatment they
              received) and 81\% for PET2-negative patients. CONCLUSION:
              Patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma for whom treatment
              was at high risk of failing appear to benefit from early
              treatment intensification with autologous transplantation, as
              indicated by the possibility of successful salvage treatment in
              more than 70\% of PET2-positive patients through obtaining the
              same 2-year progression-free survival as the PET2-negative
              subgroup.",

              commonly using thrombelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry
              (ROTEM). ROTEM-based bleeding treatment algorithms recommend
              administering platelets to patients with low EXTEM clot strength
              (e.g., clot amplitude at 10 minutes [A10] <40 mm) once clot
              strength of the ROTEM\textregistered{} fibrin-based test (FIBTEM)
              is corrected. Algorithms based on TEG typically use a low value
              of maximum amplitude (e.g., <50 mm) as a trigger for
              administering platelets. However, this parameter reflects the
              contributions of various blood components to the clot, including
              platelets and fibrin/fibrinogen. The platelet component of clot
              strength may provide a more sensitive indication of platelet
              deficiency than clot amplitude from a whole blood TEG or
              ROTEM\textregistered{} assay. The platelet component of the
              formed clot is derived from the results of
              TEG/ROTEM\textregistered{} tests performed with and without
              platelet inhibition. In this article, we review the basis for why
              this calculation should be based on clot elasticity (e.g., the E
              parameter with TEG and the CE parameter with
              ROTEM\textregistered{}) as opposed to clot amplitude (e.g., the A
              parameter with TEG or ROTEM\textregistered{}). This is because
              clot elasticity, unlike clot amplitude, reflects the force with
              which the blood clot resists rotation within the device, and the
              relationship between clot amplitude (variable X) and clot
              elasticity (variable Y) is nonlinear. A specific increment of X
              ($\Delta$X) will be associated with different increments of Y
              ($\Delta$Y), depending on the initial value of X. When calculated
              correctly, using clot elasticity data, the platelet component of
              the clot can provide a valuable insight into platelet deficiency

              control vascular haemorrhage with the formation of a stable clot.
              The fibrinogen receptor (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa [GPIIb/IIIa]) is
              the most abundant platelet integrin and, by binding fibrinogen,
              facilitates irreversible binding of platelets to the exposed
              extracellular matrix and enables the cross-linking of adjacent
              platelets. The vital role of GPIIb/IIIa requires tight control of
              both its synthesis and function. After transcription from
              distinct domains on chromosome 17, the two subunits of the
              heterodimer are carefully directed through organelles with
              intricate regulatory steps designed to prevent the cellular
              expression of a dysfunctional receptor. Similarly, exquisite
              control of platelet activation via bidirectional signalling acts
              to limit the inappropriate and excessive formation of
              platelet-mediated thrombus. However, the enormous diversity of
              genetic mutations in the fibrinogen receptor has resulted in a
              number of allelic variants becoming established. The Pro(33)
              polymorphism in GPIIIa is associated with increased
              cardiovascular risk due to a pathological persistence of
              outside-in signalling once fibrinogen has dissociated from the
              receptor. The polymorphism has also been associated with the
              phenomenon of aspirin resistance, although larger epidemiological
              studies are required to establish this conclusively. A failure of
              appropriate receptor function due to a diverse range of mutations
              in both structural and signalling domains, results in the

              Retrospective analysis was performed in 112 newly-diagnosed
              patients with APL during induction treatment. RESULTS The early
              death (ED) rate in our study was 5.36\% and the main cause was
              fetal hemorrhage. The presence of bleeding symptoms was
              significantly correlated with low platelet and fibrinogen levels.
              The values of white blood cell (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase
              (LDH), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, and bone marrow
              leukemic promyelocyte in the high-risk group were significantly

              Coagulation variables significantly improved after dual induction

  abstract = "Background: The role of intracellular radical oxygen species
              (ROS) in pathogenesis of cerebral malaria (CM) remains
              incompletely understood. Methods and Findings: We undertook
              testing Tempol - a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic and
              pleiotropic intracellular antioxidant - in cells relevant to
              malaria pathogenesis in the context of coagulation and
              inflammation. Tempol was also tested in a murine model of CM
              induced by Plasmodium berghei Anka infection. Tempol was found to
              prevent transcription and functional expression of procoagulant
              tissue factor in endothelial cells (ECs) stimulated by
              lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This effect was accompanied by
              inhibition of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein
              (MCP-1) production. Tempol also attenuated platelet aggregation
              and human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells oxidative burst. In
              dendritic cells, Tempol inhibited LPS-induced production of
              TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, and IL-12p70, downregulated expression of
              co-stimulatory molecules, and prevented antigen-dependent
              lymphocyte proliferation. Notably, Tempol (20 mg/kg) partially
              increased the survival of mice with CM. Mechanistically, treated
              mice had lowered plasma levels of MCP-1, suggesting that Tempol
              downmodulates EC function and vascular inflammation. Tempol also
              diminished blood brain barrier permeability associated with CM
              when started at day 4 post infection but not at day 1, suggesting
              that ROS production is tightly regulated. Other antioxidants -
              such as a-phenyl N-tertiary-butyl nitrone (PBN; a spin trap),
              MnTe-2-PyP and MnTBAP (Mn-phorphyrin), Mitoquinone (MitoQ) and
              Mitotempo (mitochondrial antioxidants), M30 (an iron chelator),
              and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; polyphenol from green tea)
              did not improve survival. By contrast, these compounds (except
              PBN) inhibited Plasmodium falciparum growth in culture with
              different IC50s. Knockout mice for SOD1 or phagocyte nicotinamide
              adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (gp91phox-/-) or
              mice treated with inhibitors of SOD (diethyldithiocarbamate) or
              NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium) did not show protection or
              exacerbation for CM. Conclusion: Results with Tempol suggest that
              intracellular ROS contribute, in part, to CM pathogenesis.
              Therapeutic targeting of intracellular ROS in CM is discussed.",

              chemotherapy is the standard regimen of acute promyelocytic
              leukemia. The advent of arsenic trioxide has contributed to
              improve the anti-leukemic efficacy in acute promyelocytic
              leukemia. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate if
              dual induction by all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide
              could accelerate the recovery of abnormality of coagulation and
              fibrinolysis in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
              METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed in 103
              newly-diagnosed patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
              Hemostatic variables and the consumption of component blood were
              comparably analyzed among patients treated by different induction
              regimen with or without arsenic trioxide. RESULTS: Compared to
              patients with other subtypes of de novo acute myeloid leukemia,
              patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia had lower platelet
              counts and fibrinogen levels, significantly prolonged prothrombin
              time and elevated D-dimers (P<0.001). Acute promyelocytic
              leukemia patients with high or intermediate risk prognostic
              stratification presented lower initial fibrinogen level than that
              of low-risk group (P<0.05). After induction treatment, abnormal
              coagulation and fibrinolysis of patients with acute promyelocytic
              leukemia was significantly improved before day 10. The recovery
              of abnormal hemostatic variables (platelet, prothrombin time,
              fibrinogen and D-dimer) was not significantly accelerated after
              adding arsenic trioxide in induction regimens; and the
              consumption of transfused component blood (platelet and plasma)
              did not dramatically change either. Acute promyelocytic leukemia
              patients with high or intermediate risk prognostic stratification
              had higher platelet transfusion demands than that of low-risk
              group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, adding arsenic
              trioxide could not accelerate the recovery of abnormality of
              coagulation and fibrinolysis in acute promyelocytic leukemia

              to study rare events, although detecting these events in large
              datasets remains difficult. We aimed to develop a model to
              identify leukemia patients with major hemorrhages within
              routinely recorded health records. METHODS: The model was
              developed using routinely recorded health records of a cohort of
              leukemia patients admitted to an academic hospital in the
              Netherlands between June 2011 and December 2015. Major hemorrhage
              was assessed by chart review. The model comprised CT-brain,
              hemoglobin drop, and transfusion need within 24 hours for which
              the best discriminating cut off values were taken. External
              validation was performed within a cohort of two other academic
              hospitals. RESULTS: The derivation cohort consisted of 255
              patients, 10,638 hospitalization days, of which chart review was
              performed for 353 days. The incidence of major hemorrhage was
              0.22 per 100 days in hospital. The model consisted of CT-brain
              (yes/no), hemoglobin drop of $\geq$0.8 g/dl and transfusion of
              $\geq$6 units. The C-statistic was 0.988 (CI 0.981-0.995). In the
              external validation cohort of 436 patients (19,188 days), the
              incidence of major hemorrhage was 0.46 per 100 hospitalization
              days and the C-statistic was 0.975 (CI 0.970-0.980). Presence of
              at least one indicator had a sensitivity of 100\% (CI 95.8-100)
              and a specificity of 90.7\% (CI 90.2-91.1). The number of days to
              screen to find one case decreased from 217.4 to 23.6.
              INTERPRETATION: A model based on information on CT-brain,
              hemoglobin drop and need of transfusions can accurately identify
              cases of major hemorrhage within routinely recorded health
              records.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
              time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and the related
              technique, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization
              (SELDI)-TOF MS, are being applied widely to analyze serum or
              plasma specimens for potential disease markers. METHODS: Reports
              on the basic principles and applications of MALDI-TOF MS were
              reviewed and related to information on abundance and masses of
              major plasma proteins. OUTCOMES: MALDI-TOF MS is a
              particle-counting method that responds to molar abundance, and
              ranking of plasma proteins by molar abundance increases the rank
              of small proteins relative to traditional ranking by mass
              abundance. Detectors for MALDI-TOF MS augment the bias for
              detecting smaller components by yielding stronger signals for an
              equivalent number of small vs large ions. Consequently, MALDI-TOF
              MS is a powerful tool for surveying small proteins and peptides
              comprising the peptidome or fragmentome, opening this new realm
              for analysis. It is complementary to techniques such as
              electrophoresis and HPLC, which have a bias for detecting larger
              molecules. Virtually all of the potential markers identified by
              MALDI-TOF MS to date represent forms of the most abundant plasma
              proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of serum or plasma by MALDI-TOF
              MS provide new information mainly about small proteins and
              peptides with high molar abundance. The spectrum of observed
              proteins and peptides suggests value for applications such as
              assessment of cardiovascular risk, nutritional status, liver
              injury, kidney failure, and systemic immune responses rather than
              early detection of cancer. Extending analysis by MALDI-TOF MS to
              lower abundance components, such as markers for early-stage
              cancers, probably will require more extensive specimen
              fractionation before analysis.",

              with other pro-coagulant molecules into the extracellular matrix

              immunodetection of fibrin deposits in vivo has been hampered by
              anti-fibrin cross-reactivities with fibrinogen. For the
              immunohistochemical detection of fibrin we used highly specific
              monoclonal antibodies to a synthetic fibrinunique peptide,
              because the fibrin molecule shares many epitopes with fibrinogen.
              The monoclonal antibody was applied to adenocarcinoma of colon,
              mamma, pancreas, sarcoma and acute myeloic leukemia. In all

              among patients with hematological disease and thrombocytopenia.
              Platelets are pivotal in primary hemostasis, and possess
              non-hemostatic properties involved in angiogenesis, tissue
              repair, inflammation and metastatis. Also, platelets safeguard
              vascular integrity in inflamed vessels. Overall, bleeding risk
              depends on the underlying disease, and patients with cancer and
              platelet count <6-10 $\times$ 109/L have a markedly increased
              bleeding risk, while the platelet count does not correlate with
              bleeding risk at higher platelet counts. Other factors might
              affect platelet properties and thus bleeding risk, for example,
              drugs, low hematocrit, coagulation system impairments or
              transfusion of dysfunctional donor platelets. For patients with
              leukemia and immune thrombocytopenia, reduced platelet
              activation, platelet aggregation, or thrombopoiesis, reflected by
              the reduced presence of reticulated platelets, are associated
              with bleeding phenotype. However, mechanistic insight into the
              cause of reduced platelet function in different thrombocytopenic
              conditions is sparse, except for some inherited platelet
              disorders. Promising tools for platelet function studies in
              thrombocytopenia are flow cytometry and biomarker studies on
              platelet constituents. An important message from this current
              paper is that bleeding risk assessment must be tailored to
              specific patient populations and cannot be applied broadly to all
              patients with thrombocytopenia.",

  abstract = "Anticalins are a class of engineered ligand-binding proteins that
              are based on the lipocalin scaffold. The lipocalin protein
              architecture is characterised by a compact, rigid $\beta$-barrel
              that supports four structurally hypervariable loops. These loops
              form a pocket for the specific complexation of differing target
              molecules. Natural lipocalins occur in human plasma and body
              fluids, where they usually function in the transport of vitamins,
              steroids or metabolic compounds. Using targeted mutagenesis of
              the loop region and biochemical selection techniques, variants
              with novel ligand specificities, both for low-molecular weight
              substances and for macromolecular protein targets, can be
              generated. Due to their small size, typically between 160 and 180
              residues, robust tertiary structure and composition of a single
              polypeptide chain, such 'anticalins' provide several advantages

              during storage, faster pharmacokinetics and better tissue
              penetration. At present, anticalins offer three major mechanisms

              removing toxic or otherwise irritating compounds from the human
              body; (ii) as antagonists, for example, by binding to cellular
              receptors and blocking them from interaction with their natural
              signalling molecules; (iii) as tissue-targeting vehicles, by

              independently of DMS. These findings suggest that DMS is not
              concerned with platelet liberation and that platelets are
              liberated through pseudopodia and bleb formation. In mature
              megakaryocytes vigorous amoeboid movement seems to exist and both
              pseudopodia and blebs may represent this movement. Structural
              similarity between surface connected system (SCS) of platelet and
              DMS of megakaryocyte suggests that the structure called DMS is
              transported as SCS into platelet.",

              chronic phase, 7 with CGL in blast crisis, 9 with polycythemia

              Activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were
              prolonged in many patients. Low factor II levels were observed in
              some CGL patients. Factor V was decreased in CGL patients in
              chronic phase and in PV patients. Fibrinogen was either normal or
              increased in most patients, but an elevation of fibrin/fibrinogen
              degradation products (FDP) was found in some patients. The VIIIR:

  abstract = "Background: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
              is a life-threatening condition arising from the thrombus and
              obstructive remodeling of the pulmonary arteries, which causes a
              significant morbidity and mortality. Although the modern
              treatment in CTEPH has been significant advanced both in surgical
              and medical treatment, none can claim to cure the disease,
              largely because of our limited understanding of the underlying
              pathogenesis of the disease and lack of a reliable CTEPH animal
              model to study for. Recently, inflammation has been accepted as a
              common pathway through which various risk factors trigger venous
              thrombo-embolism (VTE) formation, we describe a novel mouse model
              of CTEPH which reproduces a frequent trigger and resembles the
              time course, histological features, and clinical presentation of
              CTEPH in humans, to open a new horizons of inflammation in CTEPH.
              Methods: By administering a pulmonary embolism (PE) protocol
              (comprising 3 sequential left jugular vein injections of
              autologous blood clots) to 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley (SD)
              rats using tranexamic acid (200 mg/kg.d) to inhibit fibrinolysis
              and injecting additional carrageenan (20 mg/kg, once a week) to
              create perivascular inflammation, we successfully generated a
              CTEPH animal model. By monitoring the mean pulmonary artery
              pressure (mPAP) and the histopathological change to evaluate the
              CTEPH model. By detecting the RT-PCR, western blot, TUNEL, and
              immunohistochemistry in the sub-groups to find the potential
              mechanism of inflammation may work in the pulmonary vascular
              remolding. Results: In this study, rats with CTEPH exhibited
              pronounced pulmonary vascular remolding with higher vessel wall
              area/total area (WA/TA) ratio in comparison to the control rats
              (85.41\%$\pm$7.37\% vs. 76.41\%$\pm$5.97\%, P<0.05), the mPAP
              (25.51$\pm$1.13 vs. 15.92$\pm$1.13 mmHg, P<0.05). Significant
              differences in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) values were
              observed between rats injected solely with clots and those
              injected with both clots and carrageenan (25.51$\pm$1.13 vs.
              29.82$\pm$1.26 mmHg, P<0.05, respectively). Furthermore,
              following the third embolization, thrombi and intimal hyperplasia
              occurred in the pulmonary artery. In addition, repeated
              embolization elevated mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis
              factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), NF-$\kappa$B/p65, and B-cell
              lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), but decreased BAX expression in a
              time-dependent manner. Conclusions: Take advantage of the
              inflammation to trigger VTE formation, we successfully generated
              a CTEPH animal model. Inflammation may play a crucial role in the
              pathogenesis and progression of CTEPH by inhibiting endothelial
              cell apoptosis. Understanding the role of inflammation in CTEPH
              may not only help to determine the optimal treatment options but
              also may aid in the development of future preventative
              strategies, since current anticoagulation treatment regimens are

  abstract = "For many years, the attention on tissue factor (TF) in human
              pathophysiology has been limited to its role as initiator of
              extrinsic coagulation pathway. Moreover, it was described as a
              glycoprotein located in several tissue including vascular wall
              and atherosclerotic plaque. However, in the last two decades, the
              discovery that TF circulates in the blood as cell-associated
              protein, microparticles (MPs) bound and as soluble form, is
              changing this old vessel-wall TF dogma. Moreover, it has been
              reported that TF is expressed by different cell types, even T
              lymphocytes and platelets, and different pathological conditions,
              such as acute and chronic inflammatory status, and cancer, may
              enhance its expression and activity. Thus, recent advances in the
              biology of TF have clearly indicated that beyond its known
              effects on blood coagulation, it is a ``true surface receptor''
              involved in many intracellular signaling, cell-survival, gene and
              protein expression, proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor
              metastasis. Finally, therapeutic modulation of TF expression
              and/or activity has been tested with controversial results. This

              of extrinsic coagulation pathway, briefly illustrates the more
              recent concepts about TF and thrombosis and finally gives an
              overview about its role beyond thrombosis and haemostasis

              associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) were
              retrospectively analyzed. The clinical records were collected,
              and the associations between clinical or laboratory parameters
              and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Results: The most
              frequently clinical characteristics were fever (96.4\%), and
              splenomegaly (81.5\%). Concerning the laboratory findings, the
              most common features were hyperferritinemia (91.7\%), grade
              III/IV thrombocytopenia (64.3\%), hypertriglyceridemia (48\%),
              severe anemia (46.4\%), hypofibrinogenemia (45\%), and grade
              III/IV neutropenia (32.1\%). The interval between the diagnosis
              of NK/T LAHS and death / last contact was between 4 to 701 days
              with the median interval of 15 days. We found that higher serum
              lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) at HLH, hypofibrinogenemia, and
              splenomegaly were significantly associated with worse survival
              (P=0.002, 0.003, 0.003). Furthermore, Eastern Cooperative
              Oncology Group (ECOG) score, extra-upper aerodigestive tract NK/T
              cell lymphoma (EUNKTL) and cutaneous involvement were risk
              factors of HLH. Conclusion: Our data indicated that levels of
              LDH, fibrinogen, and presence of splenomegaly were prognostic
              factors of the disease. Higher ECOG scores, EUNKTL and cutaneous
              involvement were risk factors of NK/T LAHS. Additional
              independent, prospective clinical trials will be needed to
              explore optimal treatment.",

              myeloid leukemia (AML) with a unique morphological appearance,
              associated coagulopathy and canonical balanced translocation of
              genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17. APL was first
              described as a distinct subtype of AML in 1957 by Dr Leif
              Hillestad who recognized the pattern of an acute leukemia
              associated with fibrinolysis, hypofibrinogenemia and catastrophic
              hemorrhage. In the intervening years, the characteristic
              morphology of APL has been described fully with both classical
              hypergranular and variant microgranular forms. Both are
              characterized by a balanced translocation between the long arms
              of chromosomes 15 and 17, [t(15;17)(q24;q21)], giving rise to a
              unique fusion gene PML-RARA and an abnormal chimeric
              transcription factor (PML-RARA), which disrupts normal myeloid
              differentiation programs. The success of current treatments for
              APL is in marked contrast to the vast majority of patients with
              non-promyelocytic AML. The overall prognosis in non-promyelocytic
              AML is poor, and although there has been an improvement in
              overall survival in patients aged <60 years, only 30\%-40\% of
              younger patients are still alive 5 years after diagnosis. APL
              therapy has diverged from standard AML therapy through the
              empirical discovery of two agents that directly target the
              molecular basis of the disease. The evolution of treatment over
              the last 4 decades to include all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic
              trioxide, with chemotherapy limited to patients with high-risk
              disease, has led to complete remission in 90\%-100\% of patients

              Several links were found in hematologic malignancies between

  abstract = "Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is a purine nucleotide found in
              every cell of the human body. In addition to its well established
              role in cellular metabolism, extracellular ATP and its breakdown
              product adenosine, exert pronounced effects in a variety of
              biological processes including neurotransmission, muscle
              contraction, cardiac function, platelet function, vasodilatation
              and liver glycogen metabolism. These effects are mediated by both
              P1 and P2 receptors. A cascade of ectonucleotidases plays a role
              in the effective regulation of these processes and may also have
              a protective function by keeping extracellular ATP and adenosine
              levels within physiological limits. In recent years several
              clinical applications of ATP and adenosine have been reported. In
              anaesthesia, low dose adenosine reduced neuropathic pain,
              hyperalgesia and ischaemic pain to a similar degree as morphine
              or ketamine. Postoperative opioid use was reduced. During
              surgery, ATP and adenosine have been used to induce hypotension.
              In patients with haemorrhagic shock, increased survival was
              observed after ATP treatment. In cardiology, ATP has been shown
              to be a well tolerated and effective pulmonary vasodilator in
              patients with pulmonary hypertension. Bolus injections of ATP and
              adenosine are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of paroxysmal
              supraventricular tachycardias. Adenosine also allowed highly
              accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease. In pulmonology,
              nucleotides in combination with a sodium channel blocker improved
              mucociliary clearance from the airways to near normal in patients
              with cystic fibrosis. In oncology, there are indications that ATP
              may inhibit weight loss and tumour growth in patients with
              advanced lung cancer. There are also indications of potentiating
              effects of cytostatics and protective effects against radiation
              tissue damage. Further controlled clinical trials are warranted
              to determine the full beneficial potential of ATP, adenosine and

  abstract = "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a class of lipid
              kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
              (PIP2) at the 3-OH of the inositol ring to generate
              phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which in turn
              activates Akt and the downstream effectors like mTOR, and
              therefore play important roles in cell growth, survival, etc. The
              phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome ten (PTEN),
              acts as the catalytic antagonist of PI3K by dephosphorylating
              PIP3 to PIP2. PI3K has become an important drug target for cancer
              therapy, since gain-of-function mutations of PIK3CA encoding
              PI3K$\alpha$, as well as loss-of-function mutations of PTEN, have
              been frequently found in human cancers. The pharmaceutical
              development of PI3K inhibitors has made a great leap forward
              during the last 3 years. While PI3K$\beta$, $\delta$ and $\gamma$
              isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (TGX-221, IC87114 and AS-605240)
              have been developed for therapy of coronary heart disease,
              asthma, and glomerulonephritis, respectively, a promising
              PI3K$\alpha$ specific inhibitor is not yet available.
              Correspondingly, almost all of the promising PI3K inhibitors
              under development for caner therapy, such as NVP-BEZ235, GDC-0941
              and ZSTK474, are pan-PI3K isoform inhibitors. Each of these
              pan-PI3K inhibitors seems to induce a common G1 phase arrest. All
              have shown favorable in vivo anticancer efficacies and low
              toxicities, and therefore most have entered evaluation in
              clinical trials. P-Akt and p-S6 have been reported to be feasible
              pharmacodynamic biomarkers for monitoring the efficacy of these
              agents. In the process of discovery of these and other PI3K
              inhibitors, detailed structure-activity relationship studies were
              carried out. This review summarizes key advances in the
              development of PI3K inhibitors, which is preceded by an
              introduction of PI3K family and their functions. \copyright{}

              phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and downstream targets like the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND/AIM: Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a phospholipid-binding
              protein involved in fibrinolysis, cell proliferation, migration
              and metastatic dissemination. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are
              cells responsible for tumor dissemination and have a prognostic
              value in several types of cancers including breast cancer.
              Previously, we found correlation between CTCs and activation of
              coagulation. This study aimed to correlate CTCs with ANXA2
              expression on CTCs, tumor cells and tumor associated stroma in
              primary breast cancer (PBC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This
              prospective study included 101 PBC patients treated by primary
              surgery. CTCs were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase
              chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for the expression of epithelial
              (CK19) or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes [TWIST1,
              SNAI1, SNAI2, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)]. ANXA2
              expression on CTCs was detected by qRT-PCR, while expression of
              ANXA2 in tumor specimen was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and
              expressed by a weighted histoscore, evaluating both the
              percentage of positive cells and the intensity of membrane and
              cytoplasmic staining. Results of hormone receptors, HER2 status,
              B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) protein expression and protein p53 were
              reported as either positive or negative on histopathology report
              without further quantification. RESULTS: CTCs were detected in
              24.8\% patients. Patients with epithelial CTCs had a
              significantly higher ANXA2 expression on CTCs than those of
              patients without CTCs (p=0.01). There was no association between
              CTCs and ANXA2 protein expression in tumor cells. However,
              patients, whom CTCs with EMT phenotype were detected in, had
              higher ANXA2 expression in tumor stroma when compared to those
              with absent EMT CTCs (p=0.04). Hormone-negative tumors had
              significantly higher ANXA2 expression in tumor cells compared to
              hormone-positive tumors (p=0.03). Similarly, tumors without bcl-2
              protein expression had higher tumor levels of ANXA2 compared to
              tumor cells that were bcl-2 positive (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: ANXA2
              stromal expression might play a key role in aggressive tumor
              phenotype associated with increased EMT CTCs release, however,
              other factors beyond ANXA2 are responsible for coagulation
              activation mediated by CTCs in breast cancer patients.",

  abstract = "Introduction: A bleeding syndrome in the setting of primary
              hyperfibrinolysis in a prostate cancer patient is only 0.40--
              1.65\% of cases. The laboratory diagnosis of primary
              hyperfibrinolysis is based on the increase of biomarkers like
              D-dimer, fibrinogen split products, plasminogen, and euglobulin
              lysis test. These tests are not specific for primary
              hyperfibrinolysis. We reported a rare case of hemorrhagic
              syndrome caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis as the first
              clinical symptom of metastatic prostate cancer. Case report: A
              64-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with large
              hematomas in the right pectoral and axillary areas (20 x 7 cm),
              right hemiabdomen (30 x 30 cm) and the left lumbal area, (25 x 5
              cm). The patient had no subjective symptoms nor used any
              medication. Initial coagulation testing, prothrombin time (PT),
              and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were within the
              normal range, while fibrinogen level was extremely low (1.068
              g/L) (normal range 2.0--5.0) and the D-dimer assay result was
              high 1.122 mg/L (normal range < 0.23). The results obtained by
              rotation thrombelastometry pointed to primary fibrinolysis.
              Further clinical and laboratory examination indicated progressive
              malignant prostate disease. First line treatment for the patient
              was a combined administration of tranexamic acid (3 x 500 mg iv)
              and transfusion of ten units of cryoprecipitate (400 mL). Next
              day, fibrinolytic function measurements by rotation
              thrombelastometry were within the normal ranges. Fibrinogen level
              was normalized within two days (2.4 g/L). There were no newly
              developed hematomas. Conclusion: This case report shows primary
              hyperfibrinolysis with bleeding symptoms, which is an uncommon
              paraneoplastic phenomenon within expanded prostate malignancy.
              Rotation thrombelastometry in this severe complication helped to
              achieve the prompt and proper diagnosis and treatment.",

              and stability in reconstituted thrombocytopenia. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Thrombocytopenia (platelets [16$\pm$4]$\times$10(9)/L)
              was created by differential centrifugation of normal blood
              followed by reconstitution of whole blood which was subjected to
              clotting in a rotation thromboelastometer by CaCl2 and tissue
              factor, and to fibrinolysis by tissue plasminogen activator
              (tPA). In separate experiments, blood was diluted by 40\% with
              TRIS/saline solution. Blood was treated with fibrinogen (fib),
              factor XIII (FXIII), and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis
              inhibitor (TAFI). RESULTS: The maximum clot firmness of
              thrombocytopenic blood was approximately 2-fold less than that of
              intact blood. Supplementation of blood with fib and FXIII
              improved clot formation. In the presence of tPA, among fib, FXIII
              and TAFI, only fib stimulated clot propagation whereas each of
              these agents increased clot strength. There was a synergistic
              effect when fib was added together with FXIII or TAFI.
              Fibrinolysis was inhibited by TAFI and to a greater extent by
              TAFI + FXIII. Fourty percent dilution of blood reduced clot
              strength and increased susceptibility to tPA. Clot strength was
              increased by the treatments in the following order:
              fib/FXIII/TAFI > fib/TAFI > fib > TAFI > FXIII. In the presence
              of tPA, TAFI and FXIII lysed the clots significantly more slowly.
              This effect was stronger when blood was treated with the
              combination of fib/FXIII/TAFI. Doubling the fib concentration,
              alone or together with other agents, did not improve clot
              strength or stability. DISCUSSION: Augmentation of clot formation
              and anti-fibrinolysis by combining fib, FXIII and TAFI may be
              beneficial for the treatment of patients with severe
              thrombocytopenia especially when complicated by haemodilution

              to follow recommendations for prophylactic platelet transfusion.
              We carried out a study comparing the standard way of counting
              platelets using a routine analyser and compared it with PC
              determined by flow cytometry (FC) and haemostatic data obtained
              with thromboelastography (TEG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study
              was carried out on 24 patients with haematological malignancies,
              all given one adult dose of platelets. The PC was determined
              before and after transfusion using an automated blood cell
              counter and FC. Citrated, ``native'' whole blood TEG was carried
              out before and after platelet transfusion to assess global
              haemostasis. RESULTS: No bleeding was observed in any of the
              subjects. Thirty-one assessments were performed in the 24
              patients. The mean pre-transfusion PC were 9.8 and
              13$\times$10(9)/L with the automated counter and FC, respectively
              with a difference of 3.7 (p=0.0011). Excellent correlation was
              observed between the two counts (r=0.89; p20$\times$10(9)/L. TEG
              showed a shortened reaction time in 69.6\% of cases and a normal
              mean K time of 6.7 min. Only 9\% had a low $\alpha$ angle
              signifying hypocoagulability. The maximum amplitude was reduced
              in the majority of cases but normal in 25\% despite
              PC<20$\times$10(9)/L. Mean activated partial thromboplastin time,
              prothrombin time and fibrinogen were normal prior to transfusion.
              DISCUSSION: Although higher PC as assessed by FC could
              potentially have an impact on platelet transfusion practices, TEG
              was sensitive enough to detect PC<10$\times$10(9)/L and some
              between 10-20$\times$10(9)/L. Whether patients with the latter PC

  abstract = "Background: Transfusion of washed platelet concentrates (W-PC) is
              recommended for some patients, such as those who have had
              previous severe allergic transfusion reactions. However, we still
              lack a standardised method for preparing these products. Here, we
              assessed the effect of a manual washing procedure on in vitro
              platelet quality and on the transfusion efficacy of W-PCs.
              Materials and methods: Buffy coat-derived W-PC in Composol
              solution were prepared by one-step centrifugation. Platelet
              activation and function were evaluated before and after washing
              by means of: (i) CD62 expression by flow cytometry; (ii) platelet
              aggregation (LTA); and (iii) the VerifyNow\textregistered{} P2Y12
              test. A pilot prospective transfusion study was carried out in 11
              onco-hematology patients receiving, in a short time, two
              consecutive transfusions: one with standard PC (S-PC) and one
              with W-PC. The post-transfusion platelet increment, the 1 h and
              24 h corrected count increment (CCI) and occurrence of bleeding
              events were used as indices of transfusion efficacy. Results:
              Platelet recovery in W-PC was 84.8$\pm$5.4\%. Washing slightly
              increased platelet activation in W-PC vs pre-washed samples (\%
              CD62+ platelets 23.6$\pm$7 vs 14.8$\pm$1; p=0.03). As compared to
              prewash samples, platelet reactivity of W-PC as measured by
              VerifyNow\textregistered{} P2Y12 was significantly lower with ADP
              (PRU 32.2$\pm$37.7 vs 4.2$\pm$2.4, p=0.027), but similar using
              TRAP. Platelet aggregation responses to TRAP, collagen,
              ristocetin and arachidonic acid were maintained in W-PC. The
              pilot transfusion trial showed similar 1 h (13.5$\pm$5.6 vs
              11.5$\pm$7.3, p=0.49) and 24 h (11$\pm$7.2 vs 9$\pm$6.5, p=0.48)
              CCI for S-PC and W-PC. Transfusion of W-PC was not associated
              with an increased number of bleeding events. Discussion: We have
              set up a simple method to obtain buffy-coat-derived W-PC, which
              has minor effects on in vitro platelet quality and transfusion
              effectiveness. This procedure can be easily implemented in

              bleeding risk than that provided by platelet count alone is
              required. Multiplate\textregistered{} aggregometry and
              thromboelastography (TEG) could be used, but information on their
              role in such patients is limited. The primary aim of this study
              was to investigate the feasibility of Multiplate\textregistered{}
              analyses in patients with haematological malignancies. A
              secondary aim was to explore whether a multiple logistic
              regression model combining Multiplate\textregistered{}, TEG,
              clinical and laboratory variables was associated with risk of
              bleeding. Materials and methods. This was an exploratory,
              prospective observational study of thrombocytopenic patients with
              haematological malignancies. Total platelet count (TPC), white
              blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, temperature and
              bleeding status were recorded daily. TEG and
              Multiplate\textregistered{} analyses with four agonists were
              performed on weekdays. Results. Ten patients were enrolled into
              the study. The median number of days in a study period was 21.
              Bleeding was observed on 64 of 298 study days. TPC
              <20$\times$109/L and <10$\times$109/L occurred on 119 and 25
              days, respectively. When TPC was <33$\times$109/L, many samples
              showed no aggregation, regardless of bleeding status. Despite
              this, the odds of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2
              bleeding decreased significantly as aggregation increased and
              Multiplate\textregistered{} had a negative predictive value (NPV)
              of 96\% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 19\% for
              significant bleeding. In the multiple logistic regression model
              collagen-activated Multiplate\textregistered{} aggregation, TEG
              angle, TEG reaction time and CRP significantly affected the odds
              of WHO grade 2 bleeding. The combined model had a NPV of 99\% and
              a PPV of 19\%. Discussion. Our findings suggest that the markers

  abstract = "Fibrinolysis is a precisely orchestrated process in which
              fibrin-containing thrombi are solubilized. Several receptors
              regulate this process by localizing proteolytic activity to the
              cell surface. One such receptor is annexin II, a calcium and
              phospholipid-binding protein. Annexin II serves as a
              profibrinolytic coreceptor for both plasminogen and tissue
              plasminogen activator on the surface of endothelial cells and
              facilitates the generation of plasmin. The dysregulation of
              fibrinolytic assembly on endothelial cells may lead to
              atherothrombotic disease. In addition to its role in fibrinolysis
              at the surface of endothelial cells, annexin II may play other
              potential cellular roles. For example, the overexpression of
              annexin II on the surface of leukemic cells and cell lines
              derived from acute promyelocytic leukemia correlates with both
              the clinical manifestation of bleeding and the in vitro ability
              of the leukemic cells to generate plasmin. The abundant presence
              of annexin II on the surface of other cell types including
              monocytic cell lines and different cancer cells may contribute to
              their invasive potential through extracellular matrix either by
              generation of plasmin or, by plasmin-mediated proteolytic
              activation of other metalloproteinases. This dissolution of
              extracellular matrix may also cause the release of potent
              matrix-bound angiogenic factors such as VEGF and FGF. On the
              other hand, by increasing the pool of plasmin, a precursor to an
              important anti-angiogenic factor, angiostatin, and by
              fragmentation of collagen XVIII (a precursor to the
              anti-angigenic factor, endostatin) by plasmin-activated
              metalloproteases, annexin II could play a pivotal physiological
              role in the pro- and anti-angiogenic switch mechanism.",

              the temporal relationship and relative contributions of plasma
              and platelet components in clot lysis are mostly unknown. We
              developed a clot lysis time (CLT) assay in platelet-rich plasma

              similar one in platelet-free plasma (PFP) and to another

              studied the differential effects of a single dose of tranexamic
              acid (TXA) on these tests in healthy subjects. PFP- and PPP-CLT
              were significantly shorter than PRP-CLT, and the three assays
              were highly correlated (p < 0.0001). PFP- and PPP-, but more
              significantly PRP-CLT, were positively correlated with age and
              plasma PAI-1, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, LDL-cholesterol,
              and triglycerides (p < 0.001). All these CLT assays had no
              significant correlations with platelet aggregation/secretion,
              platelet counts, and pro-coagulant tests to explore factor X
              activation by platelets, PRP clotting time, and thrombin
              generation in PRP. Among all the studied variables, PFP-CLT was
              independently associated with plasma PAI-1, LDL-cholesterol, and
              triglycerides and, additionally, stimulated PRP-CLT was also
              independently associated with plasma fibrinogen. A single 1 g
              dose of TXA strikingly prolonged all three CLTs, but in contrast
              to the results without the drug, the lysis times were
              substantially shorter in non-stimulated or stimulated PRP than in
              PFP and PPP. This standardized PRP-CLT may become a useful tool
              to study the role of platelets in clot resistance and lysis. Our
              results suggest that initially, the platelets enmeshed in the
              clot slow down the fibrinolysis process. However, the increased
              clot resistance to lysis induced by TXA is overcome earlier in
              platelet-rich clots than in PFP or PPP clots. This is likely
              explained by the display of platelet pro-fibrinolytic effects.
              Focused research is needed to disclose the mechanisms for the
              relationship between CLT and plasma cholesterol and its potential
              pathophysiologic and clinical relevance.",

              achieved by combining different volumes of baseline whole blood
              and thrombocytopenic blood. Platelet counts were measured by flow
              cytometry (Navios, Beckman Coulter) and routine haematological

              transfusions were reduced in the study period compared with the

              Hemorrhage was slightly reduced in the study period compared with

              (p=0.014); minor hemorrhage, 63.6\% vs. 70.1\% (p<0.001). Thus,
              hemorrhage was not increased with the lower trigger level. A 10 x

              safe and effective.",

  abstract = "Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are at high risk
              for the development of life-threatening thrombotic and
              hemorrhagic complications, particularly during induction
              chemotherapy. This propensity has been attributed to the release
              of tissue factor (TF)-like procoagulants from the leukemic cells
              leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However,
              recent data suggest that the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy is
              more complicated and may involve activation of the generalized
              proteolytic cascade resulting in either clotting and/or excessive
              fibrinolysis. Furthermore, controversy exists regarding the
              mechanism(s) responsible for the activation of either clotting or
              fibrinolysis. The malignant promyelocyte may act directly to
              activate coagulation and/or fibrinolysis. Alternatively, reactive
              inflammatory cells, which express procoagulant and/or
              profibrinolytic activities may play an essential role. A third
              possibility may involve endothelial cell expression of mediators
              with procoagulant/profibrinolytic properties. Putative
              profibrinolytic mechanisms include the release of urokinase-type
              and tissue-type plasminogen activators, decreases in plasminogen
              activator inhibitor-1 and 2, and decreases in alpha-2 plasmin
              inhibitor. Putative procoagulant mechanisms include the release
              of tissue factor, Cancer Procoagulant, or cytokines such as
              interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and vascular permeability
              factor. Putative anticoagulant mediators include annexins, a
              group of proteins in human tissue which bind phospholipids and
              have anticoagulant activity, which have been reported in patients
              with APL. The current treatment of APL is rapidly evolving
              because of the efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).
              All-trans retinoic acid promotes terminal differentiation of
              leukemic promyelocytes leading to complete remission in the
              majority of patients with APL with rapid resolution of the
              coagulopathy. Although the mechanism by which this occurs has not
              been established, preliminary data suggest that ATRA blocks the
              downregulation of the thrombomodulin gene and the up-regulation
              of the tissue factor gene induced by tumor necrosis factor. Since
              APL is a relatively uncommon disorder, the collaboration of
              cooperative oncology groups will be important to study patients
              receiving ATRA or conventional chemotherapy to further elucidate
              the mechanism(s) of the coagulopathy.",

              bleeding tendency of APL is caused by a massive proteolytic
              state, triggered by procoagulant substances, plasminogen
              activators and proteinases released into the circulation from
              leukemic cells. The introduction of all-trans-retinoic acid

              These parameters were assessed before and just after high-dose
              conditioning chemotherapy, on days 1, 7, 14 and 28. Although,
              clinical manifestations associated with fibrino-coagulation
              disorders never occurred, including veno-occlusive disease, a
              statistically significant increase was seen in 7 of 30
              parameters, compared to values seen before conditioning
              chemotherapy. These were subdivided into early and late phase
              parameters. The early phase parameters, which increased during
              the first day after the conditioning chemotherapy was given, then
              returned to baseline values, included protein C, plasma tissue
              factor and tissue-plasminogen activator. The late phase
              parameters, which increased over baseline values during days 7 to
              28, included free-protein S, fibrinogen, plasmin-alpha2-plasmin

              chemotherapy. Late phase parameters increased in parallel with
              C-reactive protein, which suggests a correlation with the degree
              of inflammation, such as the presence of infective disease during
              neutropenia. These subclinical alterations in coagulation and

              development of Felty's syndrome and large granular lymphocyte
              (LGL) leukemia. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP)
              antibodies are considered highly specific for RA and are directed
              against various citrullinated antigens, including citrullinated
              fibrinogen. Anti-CCP antibodies may interfere with the detection
              of citrullinated proteins and their function. In this article, we
              describe the possible inhibition of fibrinogen by anti-CCP
              antibodies with clinical consequences which have never been
              reported in the literature to our best knowledge. CASE REPORT: We
              present the case of a 79-year-old Caucasian woman with a
              longstanding history of untreated seropositive RA and who had
              been investigated for severe neutropenia since several months.
              The association of splenomegaly led to suspicion of Felty's
              syndrome. Flux cytometry was compatible with T-cell LGL leukemia.
              In addition, severe hypofibrinogenemia was detected. The later
              finding has not been consistently associated with the former
              clinical entities. Further investigations demonstrated that the
              anti-CCP antibodies of the patient also recognized the P41
              peptide of citrullinated fibrinogen. The patient deceased of
              intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: It is likely, yet not
              definite, that high anti-citrullinated fibrinogen titers may
              contribute to low fibrinogen levels and could have contributed to
              the fatal hemorrhagic event.",

              membrane receptor GPIIb/IIIa, which plays a major role in
              platelet aggregation. Vitamin B6 has been reported to be an
              antiaggregative agent, although its mechanism is not well known.
              To understand the molecular mechanism of vitamin B6 on
              antiaggregation, we analyzed the effects of various forms of
              vitamin B6 on the expression of human GPIIb promoter using
              chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) as the reporter gene.
              The GPIIb promoter region was amplified by polymerase chain
              reaction (PCR), cloned into pBLCAT3 to drive the CAT reporter
              gene and transfected into human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells.
              Transient expression of the GPIIb promoter was determined after
              transfected cells were treated with 1 microM pyridoxine (PN),
              pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), or 4-deoxypyridoxine
              (4-dex) for 48 h. Our results show that the GPIIb promoter
              activity was down-regulated to 54, 35 and 63\% in the presence of
              PN, PL and PLP, respectively, as compared to an untreated control
              whose promoter activity was 100\%. However, no adverse effect on
              GPIIb promoter was detected by 4-dex, which is an antagonist of
              vitamin B6. The down-regulation effect of vitamin B6 on GPIIb
              promoter activity may lead to a reduction of GPIIb protein
              expression and thus be detrimental to platelet aggregation.",

              exsanguination is a common cause of death. A widely practicable
              treatment that reduces blood loss after trauma could prevent
              thousands of premature deaths each year. The CRASH-2 trial aimed
              to determine the effect of the early administration of tranexamic
              acid on death and transfusion requirement in bleeding trauma
              patients. In addition, the effort of tranexamic acid on the risk
              of vascular occlusive events was assessed. OBJECTIVE: Tranexamic
              acid (TXA) reduces bleeding in patients undergoing elective
              surgery. We assessed the effects and cost-effectiveness of the
              early administration of a short course of TXA on death, vascular
              occlusive events and the receipt of blood transfusion in trauma
              patients. DESIGN: Randomised placebo-controlled trial and
              economic evaluation. Randomisation was balanced by centre, with
              an allocation sequence based on a block size of eight, generated
              with a computer random number generator. Both participants and
              study staff (site investigators and trial co-ordinating centre
              staff) were masked to treatment allocation. All analyses were by
              intention to treat. A Markov model was used to assess
              cost-effectiveness. The health outcome was the number of
              life-years (LYs) gained. Cost data were obtained from hospitals,
              the World Health Organization database and UK reference costs.
              Cost-effectiveness was measured in international dollars ($) per
              LY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were
              performed to test the robustness of the results to model
              assumptions. SETTING: Two hundred and seventy-four hospitals in
              40 countries. PARTICIPANTS: Adult trauma patients (n = 20,211)
              with, or at risk of, significant bleeding who were within 8 hours
              of injury. INTERVENTIONS: Tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over
              10 minutes then infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) or matching
              placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was death in
              hospital within 4 weeks of injury, and was described with the
              following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial
              infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism), multiorgan failure,
              head injury and other. RESULTS: Patients were allocated to TXA (n
              = 10,096) and to placebo (n = 10,115), of whom 10,060 and 10,067
              patients, respectively, were analysed. All-cause mortality at 28
              days was significantly reduced by TXA [1463 patients (14.5\%) in
              the TXA group vs 1613 patients (16.0\%) in the placebo group;
              relative risk (RR) 0.91; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to
              0.97; p = 0.0035]. The risk of death due to bleeding was
              significantly reduced [489 patients (4.9\%) died in the TXA group
              vs 574 patients (5.7\%) in the placebo group; RR 0.85; 95\% CI
              0.76 to 0.96; p = 0.0077]. We recorded strong evidence that the
              effect of TXA on death due to bleeding varied according to the
              time from injury to treatment (test for interaction p < 0.0001).
              Early treatment (\leq 1 hour from injury) significantly reduced
              the risk of death due to bleeding [198 out of 3747 patients
              (5.3\%) died in the TXA group vs 286 out of 3704 patients (7.7\%)
              in the placebo group; RR 0.68; 95\% CI 0.57 to 0.82; p < 0.0001].
              Treatment given between 1 and 3 hours also reduced the risk of
              death due to bleeding [147 out of 3037 patients (4.8\%) died in
              the TXA group vs 184 out of 2996 patients (6.1\%) in the placebo
              group; RR 0.79; 95\% CI 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03]. Treatment given
              after 3 hours seemed to increase the risk of death due to
              bleeding [144 out of 3272 patients (4.4\%) died in the TXA group
              vs 103 out of 3362 patients (3.1\%) in the placebo group; RR
              1.44; 95\% CI1.12 to 1.84; p = 0.004]. We recorded no evidence
              that the effect of TXA on death due to bleeding varied by
              systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale score or type of
              injury. Administering TXA to bleeding trauma patients within 3
              hours of injury saved an estimated 755 LYs per 1000 trauma
              patients in the UK. The cost of giving TXA to 1000 patients was
              estimated at $30,830. The incremental cost of giving TXA compared
              with not giving TXA was $48,002. The incremental cost per LY
              gained of administering TXA was $64. CONCLUSIONS: Early
              administration of TXA safely reduced the risk of death in
              bleeding trauma patients and is highly cost-effective. Treatment
              beyond 3 hours of injury is unlikely to be effective. Future work
              [the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant
              Head injury-3 (CRASH-3) trial] will evaluate the effectiveness
              and safety of TXA in the treatments of isolated traumatic brain
              injury (http://crash3.lshtm.ac.uk/). TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current

              adult patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective
              analysis of 214 patients treated with L-asparaginase (7500
              IU/m(2) x 6) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic
              lymphoma. Between day 1 of the induction course and discharge,
              clinical events, and biological and therapeutic modifications
              were reviewed. RESULTS: Antithrombin and fibrinogen levels were
              lower than 60\% and 1 g/L in 71\% and 73\% of patients,
              respectively. Twenty thromboses occurred in 9.3\% of the
              patients; these patients had a median antithrombin level of 53\%
              (range, 21-111) at the time of the event. Forty-two episodes of
              bleeding occurred in 31 patients with a median fibrinogen level
              of 1.3 g/L. Infusions of L-asparaginase were reduced or delayed
              in 64\% of patients due to low fibrinogen and/or antithrombin
              levels. Fresh-frozen plasma, antithrombin and fibrinogen were
              infused in 31\%, 41\% and 52\% of patients, respectively. The
              mean antithrombin and fibrinogen levels increased from 61\% to
              88\% and from 1 to 1.4 g/L after infusion of antithrombin or
              fibrinogen respectively, while both levels remained unchanged
              after the infusion of fresh-frozen plasma. In patients who
              received antithrombin concentrates L-asparaginase injections were
              less frequently omitted or delayed (53\% vs. 72\%, p=0.005), the
              rate of thrombosis was lower (4.8\% vs. 12.2\%, p=0.04) and the
              disease-free survival was also reduced (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
              This retrospective study suggests that antithrombin concentrates
              may have a beneficial effect on the outcome of adults treated for
              acute lymphoblastic leukemia with L-asparaginase; prospective
              studies are essential to confirm this hypothesis.",

               <10$\times$109/L was significantly associated with a grade 2-4
               bleed (P<0.0001). Patients with a temperature of at least 38°C
               had the highest hazard of a grade 2-4 bleed (hazard ratio: 1.7,
               95\% confidence interval: 1.3 to 2.4, compared with the risk in
               patients with a temperature <37.5°C). There was no evidence that
               minor bleeding predicted a grade 2-4 bleed. The results
               highlighted the limited role of correction of thrombocytopenia
               by platelet transfusion in reducing the risk of bleeding.
               Clinically stable patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic
               stem cell transplantation had the lowest risk of bleeding and
               benefited least from prophylactic platelet transfusions.
               Prospective studies are required to address the usefulness of
               risk factors to support better targeted platelet transfusions.

              the bleeding risk is not linked to the platelet count only, other

              in 77 patients with acute leukemia, multiple myeloma or malignant

              Platelets from all patients-independent of disease or treatment
              type-were to a variable extent compromised in Ca2+ flux, integrin
              aIIb$\beta$3 activation and P-selectin expression when stimulated
              with a panel of agonists. The patients' platelets were also
              impaired in spreading on fibrinogen. Whereas the Ca2+ store
              content was unaffected, the patients' platelets showed ongoing
              phosphatidylserine exposure, which was not due to apoptotic
              caspase activity. Interestingly, mitochondrial function was
              markedly reduced in platelets from a representative subset of
              patients, as evidenced by a low mitochondrial membrane potential

              Of the 41 marine cyanobacterial strains screened, more than half

              activity against AML cells, but not against non-malignant cells

              chemotherapy-resistance-associated prosurvival protein LEDGF/p75.
              One strain (M44) was particularly promising since its activity

  abstract = "Statistical methods generally have assumptions (e.g., normality
              in linear regression models). Violations of these assumptions can
              cause various issues, like statistical errors and biased
              estimates, whose impact can range from inconsequential to
              critical. Accordingly, it is important to check these
              assumptions, but this is often done in a flawed way. Here, I
              first present a prevalent but problematic approach to
              diagnostics-testing assumptions using null hypothesis
              significance tests (e.g., the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality).
              Then, I consolidate and illustrate the issues with this approach,
              primarily using simulations. These issues include statistical
              errors (i.e., false positives, especially with large samples, and
              false negatives, especially with small samples), false binarity,
              limited descriptiveness, misinterpretation (e.g., of p-value as
              an effect size), and potential testing failure due to unmet test
              assumptions. Finally, I synthesize the implications of these
              issues for statistical diagnostics, and provide practical
              recommendations for improving such diagnostics. Key
              recommendations include maintaining awareness of the issues with
              assumption tests (while recognizing they can be useful), using
              appropriate combinations of diagnostic methods (including
              visualization and effect sizes) while recognizing their
              limitations, and distinguishing between testing and checking
              assumptions. Additional recommendations include judging
              assumption violations as a complex spectrum (rather than a
              simplistic binary), using programmatic tools that increase
              replicability and decrease researcher degrees of freedom, and
              sharing the material and rationale involved in the diagnostics.",

              carried out in 192 adult patients with HLH between 2003 and 2013.
              RESULTS: Of the 192 cases, 70 cases were secondary to cancer and
              64 cases secondary to infection. According to HLH-2004 criteria,
              the coincidence rate of indices were: fever (98.96\%), high level
              of serum ferritin (94.27\%), increased level of soluble
              interleukin- 2 receptor(sCD25) (94.79\%), decreased or absent
              activity of NK cells (94.27\%), cytopenias (80.73\%),
              splenomegaly (80.21\%), emophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen or
              lymph nodes (74.48\%), hypofibrinogenemia (50.52\%),
              hypertriglyceridemia (37.50\%). In addition, 94.27\% of patients
              were presented with liver dysfunction, 96.35\% with infections,
              and 75.52\% with coagulopathy. Incidences of central nervous
              system symptoms and rash were 19.27\% and 20.31\%, respectively.

              secondary HLH occurs from various underlined diseases. Cancer,
              especially T- cell lymphoma, is the main cause, Secondly, it is
              EB virus infection. The diagnostic sensitive indicators are

              than those in the normal control and ITP-CR groups. The
              expression level of PAC-1 was lower in the ITP-CR and normal
              control groups. No differences were identified in CD62p and CD42b
              expression levels. Following ATP activation, CD62p, PAC-1 and
              CD42b expression in the ITP group was lower than that in the
              normal control and ITP-CR groups. PAC-1 expression was lower
              while CD62p expression was higher in the ITP-CR group compared to
              the normal control group. In conclusion, the activation of
              platelets in ITP children was low. Decreased platelet function,
              platelet parameters and platelet glycoproteins may be used as
              markers for monitoring the treatment efficacy in ITP children.",

  abstract = "Acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) is a rare subtype of acute
              myeloid leukemia (AML), which is challenging to diagnose due to
              frequent myelofibrosis (MF) and a low percentage of blast cells.
              In the present study, clinical characteristics and experimental
              observations in 9 adult patients diagnosed with AMKL, who were
              recruited by the Sino-U.S. Shanghai Leukemia Co-operative Group,
              were analyzed in order to summarize the diagnostic experience and
              provide recommendations on diagnosing AMKL. All the patients were
              diagnosed according to the 2008 World Health Organization
              diagnostic criteria. The mean age of the patients with AMKL was
              59 years (range, 53-68 years). A total of 8 patients had
              different degrees of anemia, and 2 patients had 20\%, as
              demonstrated by flow cytometry. A total of 6 patients were
              positive for platelet-specific antigens, as indicated by
              immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, 7 patients presented with
              moderate or marked MF, as demonstrated by a bone marrow biopsy.
              Karyotypic analysis indicated that 6 patients had abnormal
              karyotypes. Only 1 patient exhibited the Janus kinase 2V617F
              mutation. Treatment efficiency was notably poor, with a median
              survival time of 6.0 months (range, 1.1-24.0 months). In
              conclusion, the diagnosis of AMKL requires a combination of the
              results of bone marrow smears and bone marrow biopsy,
              immunophenotype or immunohistochemistry. We recommend that
              routine immunophenotypic analysis should include the CD41 and
              CD61 markers for diagnosing acute leukemia when bone marrow

              tumor cell invasion and metastasis",
  author   = "Kobayashi, H and Terao, T",
  abstract = "Tumor cells (human choriocarcinoma SMT-cc1 cells and human
              promyeloid leukemia U937 cells) express urinary trypsin inhibitor
              (UTI)-like immunoreactive substance. Because of the prominent
              inhibitory effects of exogenous UTI on tumor cell invasive and
              metastatic potential, it is important to determine whether there
              is endogenous UTI production by these cells. Most of
              cell-associated UTI is located on the cell surface.
              Immuno-precipitates of the particulate fraction contained three
              different polypeptide chains including M(r) >200 kDa, 125 kDa,
              and a polydisperse band of M(r) 40 kDa, which is confirmed to be
              UTI by amino acid sequence analysis. In SMT-cc1 cells
              pulse-labeled with [S-35]sulfate, a polyclonal antibody against
              UTI precipitated labeled proteins of >200 kDa, 125 kDa, 93 kDa,
              69 kDa, and 40 kDa. Upon chase, very low levels of 40 kDa band
              could be detected in lysates. On the other hand, although UTI was
              immunoprecipitated from U937 cells and the cells were
              immunohistochemically positive with anti-UTI antibody, UTI
              remained unlabeled even after long incubation of the cells with
              [S-35]sulfate. This suggests that SMT-cc1 cells may produce
              endogenous UTI, but U937 cell-associated UTI, which may not be
              generated by U937 cells themselves, may be taken up onto the cell
              surface from the serum. SMT-cc1 cells were invasive on the
              Matrigel in an in vitro assay. Exogenously applied UTI
              efficiently inhibits tumor cell invasion in a dose-dependent
              manner. Furthermore, addition of anti-UTI antibody to the cells
              enhanced cell-associated caseinolytic activity. Anti-UTI antibody
              produced biphasic, concentration-dependent changes in tumor cell
              invasion. Although invasion by the cells was enhanced by addition
              of lower concentrations (0.5 mu g/ml) of antibody blocked tumor
              cell invasion, suggesting that too much cell-associated
              proteolytic activity may cause uncontrolled matrix degradation.
              Our results suggest that certain tumor cells express UTI on their
              cell surface and that membrane-bound UTI may control proteolysis
              and contribute to prevent the excessive fibrinolysis in condition
              such as tumor invasion.",

              communicate the ADR observed with the use E coli asparaginase (E
              coli ASP) in children with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia (ALL).
              PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of clinical records
              of all the patients aged less than 15 years with ALL (n =52) and
              treated between January 1996 and April 2000. The suspicion of ADR
              to E coli ASP was evaluated using the Karch and Lasagna
              algorithm. Probable and definitive cases of ADR to E coli ASP
              were subjected to a protocol of clinical and epidemiological
              data. The risk factors associated to ADR to E coli ASP, were also
              determined. RESULTS: Fifty children aged 1 to 13 years (33 men)
              were studied. In 20 (40\%), an ADR to E coli ASP, was suspected.
              After the use of the algorithm, the ADR was considered definite
              in two patients, probable in 17 and possible in one. The
              registered clinical events were urticaria in 17, anaphylactic
              shock in four, transient alterations of hepatic functions test in
              seven and hypofibrinogenemia in four. The test of cutaneous

              to the administration of the drug, were positive in nine of the
              20 children with adverse reactions. No children died.
              CONCLUSIONS: The application of the Karch anbd Lasagna algorithm,

              antileukemic therapy, indicating a possible interaction of
              disease and therapy. Aims: To study the effect of induction
              chemotherapy on coagulation parameters in pediatric ALL patients.
              Settings and Design: Thirty-seven newly diagnosed patients of ALL
              up to 18 years of age were evaluated along with 30 age- and
              sex-matched controls. Subjects and Methods: At the time of
              diagnosis (day 0), various coagulation parameters were tested.
              These were sequentially analyzed on day 14 (after the completion
              of L-asparaginase doses) and on day 28 of therapy (after the
              completion of induction). Prothrombin time (PT), activated
              partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, protein C (PC)
              activity, and protein S (PS) activity were done by a clot-based
              method. Antithrombin (AT) assay was performed by chromogenic
              method. D-dimer (D-DI), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and
              plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) levels were
              assayed by ELISA method. Statistical Analysis Used: The
              statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for
              Social Sciences version 17.0. Results: No major change in PT and
              APTT was observed during chemotherapy; however, fibrinogen levels
              declined significantly (P = 0.04), following L-asparaginase
              treatment. D-DI levels were significantly raised at diagnosis (P
              < 0.001) and throughout induction therapy (P < 0.001). PC, PS,
              and AT were reduced in the initial part of induction, followed by
              a rise in the second half of therapy, reaching their respective
              baseline levels (P < 0.05). The tPA levels were significantly
              reduced in the patients at diagnosis and throughout therapy (P <
              0.001). PAI-1 levels were comparable to controls at presentation
              and showed a rising trend during therapy. Conclusions: The
              results of this study indicated that both the malignant process
              and the drugs used in combined chemotherapy cause thrombin
              activation, decrease in natural inhibitors, and hypofibrinolysis,
              resulting in hypercoagulability. Thus, ALL per se is a
              hypercoagulable state and the prothrombotic condition at the time
              of diagnosis gets enhanced during induction chemotherapy.",

              METHODS: The study included 30 patients. Twelve were clinically
              diagnosed as aplastic anemia and the 18 were of acute myeloid
              leukemia. A prospective 3 months follow-up was planned to monitor
              the response of platelet transfusion therapy, based on their
              posttransfusion corrected count increment at 1(st) and 24(th) h.
              Based on the observations, patients were categorized into
              refractory and nonrefractory groups. Common nonimmunological
              causes such as fever, sepsis, bleeding, disseminated
              intravascular coagulation, chemotherapy, splenomegaly, ABO
              mismatch, and antithymocyte globulin therapy were monitored.
              Among the immunological causes, presence of antihuman leukocyte
              antigen (HLA) class I antibodies and platelet glycoprotein
              antibodies in patient's serum were monitored. RESULTS: During the
              study period, 17 (56.66\%) patients did not show desired platelet
              count increment. Transfusion requirements of refractory group for
              both red cell and platelet product were significantly higher (P <

              total of 41 NTCL patients who received IMEP plus native E. coli
              L-ASP or PEG-ASP at Seoul National University Hospital were
              included in this study between January 2013 and March 2016.
              IMEP/ASP treatment consisted of ifosfamide, methotrexate,
              etoposide, plus native E. coli L-ASP (6,000 IU/m2 on days 1, 3,
              5, 7, 9, and 11) or PEG-ASP (2,500 IU/m2 on day 1) every 3 weeks.
              ASP-related toxicities, toxicity patterns, length of hospital
              stay, and clinical outcomes were compared between the different
              treatment groups. Results: The frequency of ASP-related
              toxicities was similar between the IMEP plus native E. coli L-ASP
              group and the PEG-ASP group apart from hypofibrinogenemia (native
              E. coli L-ASP vs. PEG-ASP group, 86.4\% vs. 36.8\%; p=0.001).
              Although post-treatment transaminase and albumin levels were
              significantly high and low, respectively, hepatotoxicity
              gradients before and after treatment did not differ significantly
              between the groups. Since PEG-ASP was given at an outpatient
              clinic in some patients, length of hospital stay was
              significantly shorter in the IMEP plus PEG-ASP group (median, 4.0
              vs. 6.0 days; p=0.002). A favorable tendency of clinical outcomes
              was observed in NTCL patients treated with IMEP plus PEG-ASP
              (complete remission rate, 73.7\% vs. 45.5\%; p=0.067).
              Conclusion: IMEP plus PEG-ASP showed similar ASP-related
              toxicities, shorter length of hospital stay, and a trend towards
              improved clinical outcomes compared with IMEP plus native E. coli

              failure. The diagnosis of HLH is made late by most physicians.
              METHODS: To confirm the diagnosis of acquired HLH made in a
              single-institution series of adult patients with HLH-04 criteria,
              we applied the HScore and evaluated prognostic factors associated
              with clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients with a
              median age of 51 years (range 17-90) were included. Male/female
              ratio was 111/63. In 92/174 (52.9\%) patients, there were
              potential haematological diseases (4 acute leukaemia, 1
              thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma [HL],
              17 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], 67 T-cell NHL including
              22 natural killer / T-cell NHL [NK/t-cell NHL). Six (3.4\%)
              patients had autoimmune disease and 76 (43.7\%) undiagnosed
              underlying disease. There were 44 (25.3\%) patients with
              Epstein-Barr virus infection, 11 (6.3\%) with cytomegalovirus, 1
              (0.5\%) syphilis, 9 (5.2\%) hepatitis B virus and 3 (1.7\%) human
              immunodeficiency virus. More than 95\% of patients had
              hyperferritinaemia, high lactate dehydrogenase, fever and low
              albumin, whereas 89.1\% of patients had bone marrow phagocytosis.
              By the HScore, 4/174 patients had a >50\% and 16/174 patients had
              a >90\% probability of not having HLH. All 174 patients fulfilled
              more than five of the HLH-04 diagnostic criteria, but 16 of them
              had a low probability of HLH by the HScore. In a multivariate
              analysis, lymphopenia and hypofibrinogenaemia were independent
              prognostic factors for death. CONCLUSION: In our study, viral
              infection was not an independent prognostic factor. NK/T-cell
              -NHL was associated with worse prognosis compared with B-cell NHL
              and T-cell NHL (p = 0.036) and similar to other aetiologies.",

              cardiovascular risk factor. DATA IDENTIFICATION: A computerized
              literature search (1980 to 1992) identified all published
              epidemiologic studies on fibrinogen and cardiovascular disease.
              Clinical and basic research data were found by separate searches.
              References of all papers thus obtained were studied and relevant
              papers included. STUDY SELECTION: Six prospective epidemiologic
              studies were included in a meta-analysis (one study was excluded
              because the study population was non-representative). Clinical
              papers were reviewed separately for other evidence of causation.
              DATA EXTRACTION: The correlation of fibrinogen levels on the
              subsequent incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and
              peripheral arterial occlusive disease was assessed and the
              causality of the association was analyzed. Calculations were made
              to examine fibrinogen level (in tertiles) versus cardiovascular
              risk. Odds ratios of high versus low tertile were computed.
              RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: All prospective studies showed that
              fibrinogen was associated with subsequent myocardial infarction
              or stroke. A total of 92,147 person-years was covered by these
              investigations. Odds ratios varied between 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.2 to
              2.5) in the Framingham and 4.1 (CI, 2.3 to 6.9) in the GRIPS
              study, with a summary odds ratio of 2.3 (CI, 1.9 to 2.8).
              Associations existed between fibrinogen and other cardiovascular
              risk factors, but after multivariate analysis, only the
              association between fibrinogen and cardiovascular events
              remained. The majority of the preconditions for causality were

              therapy. The clinical date and therapeutic outcome of 25 cases of
              APL combined with DIC treated from January 2008 to March 2013 in
              our department were analysed retrospectively. The 25 patients
              were given ATRA 20 mg orally twice a day and arsenic trioxide
              (ATO) 10 mg intravenously once a day to induce differentiation
              therapy, the chemotherapy was added after degranulation of
              promyelocytes. At the same time the platelets, fresh frozen
              plasma, fibrinogen, cryoprecipitate,prothrombin complex and amino
              methylbenzoic acid, low molecular weight heparin were given to
              treat DIC. According to the laboratorial examination of
              coagulation and fibrinolysis, the medication was adjusted.The
              white blood cell count, platelet level, prothrombin time (PT),
              partial thromboplastin time of plasma (APTT), fibrinogen level
              were detected, and the relation of those factors and age with
              bleeding severity was analyzed by multivariate manner. The
              results showed that among 25 patients with APL (low-risk 5 cases,
              intermediate risk 13 cases and high risk 7 cases), 22 cases
              combined with DIC, incidence of DIC was 88\%. Out of 22 patients
              with DIC 21 patients (95.5\%) were corrected, except 1 case
              death. After the first course of treatment, 23 cases (92\%)
              gained complete remission (CR) with average CR time 31.8 $\pm$
              7.2 days. During the induction of CR, the average platelet
              transfusion level was 75.68 $\pm$ 55.88 U, the RBC level was 8.90
              $\pm$ 5.69 U, the average level of fresh frozen plasma
              transfusion of APL patients with DIC was 21.92 $\pm$ 19.32 U. The
              recovery time of platelet level to normal was 29.3 $\pm$ 9.3
              days, the recovery time of PT, APTT, FDP and fibrinogen to normal
              were 12.7 $\pm$ 9.5 days, 11.6 $\pm$ 8.6 days, 16.0 $\pm$ 9.3
              days and 125.3 $\pm$ 85.3 days respectively. The multivariate
              analysis showed that WBC count at onset was >10 $\times$ 10(9)/L
              and APTT was prolonged. These two factors were main reasons
              resulting in severe bleeding. It is concluded that the newly
              diagnosed APL always combined with DIC, therefore in the early
              phase of disease active transfusion of blood products,
              application of anti-coagulation and anti-fibrinolytic drugs as
              well as heparin should be performed; the coagulation function
              should be as soon as recovered to normal so as to early correct
              DIC. These measures can significantly decrease the mortality of
              APL patients resulting from DIC. The hyperleukocytosis and
              prolonged APTT are the main factors for severe bleeding.",

              in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was
              analyzed. Although the plasma ATIII activity was decreased in
              patients with DIC, no significant correlation was observed
              between plasma level of ATIII and that of thrombin-antithrombin
              III complex or prothrombin fragment 1+2. The extent of the
              decrease of ATIII in DIC was the most marked in cases associated
              with septicemia. The plasma level of ATIII in septicemia without
              DIC was significantly lower than that in DIC cases without
              septicemia, suggesting that the decrease of ATIII level could not
              be related to the pathophysiology of DIC, but to that of
              septicemia. The plasma half-life of ATIII in septicemia without
              DIC was significantly shortened in the absence of the increase of
              TAT level, suggesting that the extravasation of ATIII might be
              induced probably due to the endothelial damage in septicemia. The
              alpha 2-Plasmin inhibitor level was decreased in DIC patients.
              The decrease was the most marked (lower than 60\% of normal) in
              patients with excessive fibrinolysis in which fibrinogen
              degradation was induced. The plasma level of alpha 2PI was
              significantly higher in the DIC cases with septicemia than in
              those without septicemia. The ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio was
              significantly lower in DIC cases with septicemia than in those
              with solid tumor or acute leukemia. Moreover, the ATIII/alpha 2PI
              ratio was significantly lower in MOF cases than in non-MOF cases
              in septicemia. The mortality of the MOF cases did not correlate
              with the ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio, but with the plasma level of
              PAI-1, suggesting that the decrease of ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio
              might not reflect the irreversible endothelial cell damage. Based
              on these observations, the calculation of ATIII/alpha 2PI in DIC
              patients would provide the following information; (1) a low
              ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio (less than 0.6) was frequently observed in
              septicemia, which could be related to the occurrence of organ
              dysfunction; (2) a high ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio (higher than 1.0)
              with the marked decrease of alpha 2PI level (lower than 60\% of
              normal) suggests the occurrence of excessive fibrinolysis in
              which anti-fibrinolytic therapy should be considered when
              clinical bleeding was present; (3) The ATIII/alpha 2PI ratio near
              1.0 was observed in DIC associated with the pathological
              conditions other than described above, such as solid tumors, in
              which the coagulation and fibrinolysis was almost equally

  abstract = "Megakaryocytopoiesis, the process by which hematopoietic stem
              cells develop into mature megakaryocytes (MK), and
              thrombopoiesis, platelet production/release, are critical for
              blood homeostasis. We tested the hypothesis that the Rho guanine
              exchange factor, ARHGEF12 (also known as LARG), is critical for
              MK differentiation and platelet functions based on the following:
              1) ARHGEF12 is part of a recurrent translocation with MLL in
              acute myeloid leukemia. 2) Both published microarray datasets and
              deep-sequencing data from our lab on primary human CD34+ cells
              differentiating into MKs show that ARHGEF12 expression goes up
              dramatically during MK differentiation. 3) ARHGEF12 is one of the
              most highly expressed guanine exchange factors in platelets. 4)
              ARHGEF12 forms a complex with G proteins and stimulates
              Rho-dependent signals. It is known that platelet activation can
              be initiated by extracellular stimuli working through G
              protein-coupled receptors and Rho signaling, suggesting that
              ARHGEF12 may function in platelet activation. 5) Mice with KO of
              RhoA (a known ARHGEF12 substrate) in the MK-lineage have
              macrothrombocytopenia and defective platelet activation. To test
              this hypothesis, we used ARHGEF12 shRNA mediated KD and an
              ARHGEF12 specific pharmacological inhibitor (Y16) in both murine
              and human primary cells, and characterized a LARG KO mouse model
              for MK and platelet phenotypes, and found: ARHGEF12 is
              differentially upregulated during MK differentiation and is
              enriched in platelets Using quantitative RT-PCR and western blot
              analysis at different timepoints of primary FACSorted Mk
              progenitors induced to differentiate into mature MK in vitro,
              ARHGEF12 RNA and protein expression increases during MK
              differentiation in both the murine and human systems. Also
              western blot analysis of murine platelet rich plasma shows that
              ARHGEF12 protein is highly expressed in platelets. ARHGEF12 is
              essential for human MK differentiation To test the function of
              ARHGEF12 in Mk differentiation, we used lentiviral shRNA to
              knockdown ARHGEF12 in FACSorted primary human Mk progenitors from
              mobilized peripheral blood differentiated in vitro to MK. The
              results show that ARHGEF12 knockdown blocks MK polyploidization
              (not shown) and maturation (Fig. A). This was confirmed using a
              published ARHGEF12 inhibitor (Y16) in the differentiation culture
              of human MK progenitors, in which there was a dose-dependent
              block in MK differentiation (Fig. B). These data suggested that
              ARHGEF12 is essential for human MK differentiation. We researched
              the function of ARHGEF12 in the murine system using a
              constitutive ARHGEF12 knockout mouse model. The mice have
              enlarged platelets (p=0.07) and a decreased platelet count
              (p=0.01). However, the knockout mice have normal BM cellularity
              with no change in megakaryocyte number or ploidy, suggesting that
              ARHGEF12 is dispensable for murine MK differentiation in vivo.
              ARHGEF12 is essential for platelet function in both the murine
              and human systems: To test whether ARGEF12 functions in platelet
              activation, we compared WT versus KO platelet activation in
              vitro. We tested activation in response to ADP, U46619
              (Thromboxane), ADP+U46619, and Thrombin. KO plateelts have
              significantly reduced activation in response to U46619 and
              thrombin, with no effects on ADP-induced activation. Analogous
              studies using the ARHGEF12 inhibitor (Y16) on WT platelets
              revealed supportive evidence. Lastly, we tested ARHGEF12 function
              in human platelet aggregation using the Y16 compound. Consistent
              with the murine data, Y16 blocked platelet aggregation in
              response to both U46619 and Thrombin. Taken together, these data
              strongly suggest that ARHGEF12 is essential for platelet function
              and acts downstream of the Thromboxane and Thrombin receptors. In
              summary, we found that ARHGEF12 is differentially up-regulated in
              MK differentiation both in human and in mouse system,. It plays a
              critical role in human Mk differentiation but is dispensable in
              murine MK differentiation, and ARHGEF12 is critical for platelet
              functions in both human and mouse systems, potentially acting
              downstream of Thromboxane and Thrombin receptors.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical manifestations, laboratory
              findings, treatment and prognosis of patients with hemophagocytic
              syndrome (HPS). METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out to
              analyze the underlying disease, clinical characteristics,
              laboratory findings and outcomes of 46 patients with HPS.
              RESULTS: This cohort included 19 cases of HPS secondary to
              cancer, 11 cases of HPS secondary to infection, 10 cases of
              suspected malignant lymphoma based on PET-CT findings (without
              biopsy), and 6 cases of unknown etiology. The coincidence rate of
              the clinical characteristics of the patients with the indices
              listed in HPS-2004 criteria were: fever (100\%), elevated serum
              ferritin (100\%), cytopenias (93.48\%), splenomegaly (91.30\%),
              hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes
              (84.78\%), hypofibrinogenemia (67.39\%), and hypertriglyceridemia
              (54.05\%). The cases of cancer, infections and unknown etiology
              showed significant differences in serum levels of ferritin and
              $\beta$2MG (P<0.05), and significant differences were found in
              triglycerides, LDH, and fibrinogenemia between the nonfatal and
              fatal cases (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: HPS can be secondary to various
              underlying diseases, many associated with Epstein-Barr virus
              infection. Cancer, especially NK/T-cell lymphoma, is the main
              cause of HPS. Persistent fever, elevated serum ferritin level and
              cytopenias are the most sensitive indicators for diagnosis of
              HPS, and early diagnosis and treatment are critical to lower the
              mortality rate of this disease.",

              acid was inhibited by indomethacin, 1 $\mu$g/ml. RBL-l incubated
              with exogenous arachidonic acid also formed SRS-A the synthesis
              of which was not inhibited by indomethacin. However, the SRS-A
              activity was blocked by the specific receptor antagonist FPL
              55712. [14C]arachidonic acid was effectively incorporated into
              the phospholipids of RBL-l cells. Challenge of such prelabelled
              cells or unlabelled cells with A 23187 caused release of PGD2,
              SRS-A and another presently unidentified product. However, with A
              23187 as a stimulus, the RBL-l cyclooxygenase could not be

              substantiates our earlier findings that SRS-A formed from
              arachidonic acid is not a cyclooxegenase product.",

  abstract = "Introduction: Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is an adhesive
              glycoprotein that is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB).
              Secretagogues, such as thrombin or histamine, cause endothelial
              cell (EC) activation followed by WPB exocytosis and
              thereforeVWFrelease. It was shown that luminal secretedVWFforms
              ultra-large fibres which are immobilised on the EC surface. In
              this context shear flow mediates VWF uncoiling which transforms
              VWF to a highly adhesive protein. Recent data indicate thatVWF
              plays also a pivotal role in inflammation besides its function in
              platelet adhesion. In this study, we examined the interaction of
              ultra large VWF (ULVWF) and platelets/leukocytes under flow
              conditions to elucidate its contribution to the initiation of
              leukocyte adhesion, rolling and transmigration. Methods: To mimic
              conditions of the microvasculature, we established different
              microfluidic devices for unidirectional flow experiments at well
              defined shear rates. In our microfluidic experiments we
              superfused human endothelial cells with the human acute monocytic
              leukemia cell line THP1, peripheral blood-derived human monocytes
              as well as with human whole blood samples. Results: We could show
              that leukocytes adhere and migrate on a VWF functionalised
              surface as well as on stimulated endothelial cells. Furthermore,
              by using reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM) we
              were able to study VWFmediated leukocyte adhesion in whole human
              blood samples.Moreover we could demonstrate that VWF-mediated
              platelet binding further supports leukocyte adhesion. Conclusion:
              Our studies indicate that VWF mediates endothelium-platelet
              binding as well as leukocyte adhesion even under high shear flow.
              The capacity of VWF on leukocyte recruitment emphasises the role
              ofVWF not only in coagulation but also in inflammation.",

              platelets labeled with 51Cr in patients with acute leukemia (AL).
              SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven donor volunteers and 39 patients with
              different forms with AL at various stages of polychemotherapy
              (PCT) were examined. Cytostatic therapy was accompanied by
              51Cr-labeled platelet concentrate (PC) transfusions. The patients
              were on appropriate high-dose (HD) PCT. RESULTS: The duration of
              donor platelet circulation was 8-10 days in healthy individuals.
              No platelet hypersequestration was recorded in both the spleen
              and the liver. Donor platelet survival was shorter in all
              patients with in a state of cytostatic cytopenia. There was an
              inverse correlation between the degree of circulation shortening
              and some clinical and hematological parameters (the bone marrow
              level of blastemia and blastosis, the XIIa-dependent fibrinolysis
              parameters). Four variants of radioactivity trends above the
              spleen and liver were identified. The findings suggest that there
              is platelet hypersequestration in the spleen, liver, and both
              organs. In some patients, the above both organs are uninvolved in
              the hypersequestration processes and the possible mechanism for
              increased consumption of transfused donor platelets, which is
              associated with recovery of the HD PCT-damaged vascular

              donor platelet circulation was found in relation to the level of
              blastosis. The described procedure may be used as one of the
              additional methods for evaluating the efficacy of donor PC
              transfusion and for specifying the pathogenesis of
              thrombocytopenias in AL patients on programmed HD PCT. A
              procedure is proposed to time the circulation of 51Cr-labeled
              platelets, by assessing deposit phenomena and estimating the
              level of their sequestration in the spleen and liver for the

              of plasminogen with surface-bound MIP-2alpha. Binding and
              competition experiments indicated that the interaction involves
              the region comprising the first 3 kringles of plasminogen and the
              COOH-terminal lysine-rich domain of MIP-2alpha. Activation of

              Methods: Purified platelets, obtained from AML-patients and
              normal control subjects, were examined for surface membrane
              GP1b-expression by flow cytometry and GP1b-mediated aggregation

  abstract = "Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2, PGI2) is a potent vasodilator and
              inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Although it is well known that
              the specific receptor for prostacyclin (PGI2-R) is abundantly
              expressed on platelets, PGI2-R expression in megakaryocytes is
              poorly understood. In this study, we examined its expression in
              leukemic or normal megakaryocytes. PGI2-R mRNA was expressed in
              human leukemic cell lines of megakaryocytic nature as evaluated
              by Northern blot analysis. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),
              interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage
              colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thrombopoietin (TPO), and
              tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) enhanced PGI2-R mRNA
              expression. The enhancement of PGI2-R expression by PMA and TPO
              was associated with the upregulation of platelet factor 4 or
              glycoprotein IIb mRNA expression. Iloprost, an agonist of
              prostacyclin, induced significant cyclic (c)AMP synthesis in
              these leukemic cells indicating that interaction of PGI2-R and
              its ligand can induce postreceptor signal transduction.
              Furthermore, iloprost-induced cAMP synthesis was enhanced by the
              pretreatment with PMA or the cytokines that promoted PGI2-R
              expression. PMA and TPO also increased the specific binding of
              [3H]iloprost to these cells. Pooled normal megakaryocytic
              colonies from TPO-containing semisolid culture of purified human
              CD34+ cells expressed PGI2-R, which were increased as the
              megakaryocytes matured with the peak expression before
              proplatelet formation, as evaluated by semiquantitative reverse
              transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These results
              indicate that PGI2-R is expressed in human megakaryocytes and is
              upregulated by cytokines involved in thrombopoiesis or
              inflammation. Also, it was indicated that megakaryocytic
              maturation accompanies enhancement of PGI2-R expression.",

              diagnosis and after induction therapy",
  author   = "{Tsoran-Rosenthal I.} and {Brenner B.} and {Aharon A.}",
  abstract = "Background: Microparticles (MPs) are membrane vesicles shed from
              various cells that may express antigens reflecting their cellular
              origin. Tissue factor (TF)-bearing MPs play a major role in the
              pathogenesis of the prothrombotic state observed in patients with
              malignancies. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by
              rapid growth of abnormal blast cells that accumulate in the bone
              marrow and interfere with production of normal blood cells. AML
              patients can develop venous thromboembolism despite
              thrombocytopenia. We hypothesize that circulating MPs may serve
              as a biomarker, capable to reflect the change in blood cells
              population and predict thrombogenic states in AML patients at
              diagnosis and in remission. Methods: Blood samples were collected
              from healthy controls and patients with newly diagnosed AML at
              three time points: diagnosis, 2 weeks after treatment initiation
              and at remission achievement. Microparticle cell origins were
              characterized by specific fluorescent antibodies and analyzed by
              FACS. The fluorescent antibodies included: CD41 (platelet
              glycoprotein complex), CD 62P (P-selectin expressed on activated
              platelets); CD62E and CD144 (endothelial markers), CD11
              (leukocyte marker), CD14 (monocyte marker) and Annexin V (for MPs
              expressing negative phospholipids on their surface). To
              distinguish MP from cancer cells, MPs were labeled by CD34,
              CD117, CD33, and HLA-DR (for leukemic blast cells). In FACS
              analysis used to determine the pro- and anti-coagulant potential
              of microparticles in the study groups, each sample of MPs was
              labeled with fluorescent antibodies against TF, TF pathway
              inhibitor (TFPI) and markers of the protein C anticoagulant
              pathway - endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). The TF/TFPI
              ratio, potentially contributing to detection of the
              hypercoagulable state was calculated. Results: Twenty AML
              patients were enrolled in the study; 13 patients achieved
              remission following induction therapy. The average MP count in
              patients at diagnosis was higher than in controls and than that
              observed at two other points of treatment (at nadir and
              remission), although the difference did not reach statistical
              significance. Conversely, the level of Annexin V expression was
              significantly higher in controls compared to patients at three
              time points of sampling. The platelet marker CD41 was
              significantly higher in controls compared to the rates of
              patients at diagnosis (33.7\% vs. 5.9\%; P < 0.05), without
              changes in platelet activation markers. The endothelial marker
              CD144 appeared to be higher in patients' MP at diagnosis compared
              to controls (16.4\% vs. 4.48\%; P < 0.05). The blast cells marker
              CD34 was significantly elevated in patients at diagnosis compared
              to controls (3.15\% vs. 0.0; P < 0.001) and to patients in
              remission (3.15\% vs. 0.0; P < 0.05). TF expression was similar
              in controls and patients at three time points tested; however,
              the TFPI level was higher in controls' MPs compared to patients,
              without changes in MPs EPCR. Conclusion: In AML patients, the MPs
              number was higher at diagnosis and reduced after treatment. MPs
              of AML patients at diagnosis express markers of blast cells and
              may serve as a biomarker for disease and remission. Increase in
              endothelial MP level at AML diagnosis may indicate vascular
              injury, which could result in TFPI reduction and lead to the
              hypercoagulable state.",

              outcome of patients with secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia
              (APL) and compare them to those with primary APL. One hundred and
              thirteen patients referred to our service with a diagnosis of APL
              were reviewed. Fourteen were classified as secondary APL. Nine
              were induced with chemotherapy, and five with all-trans retinoic
              acid plus chemotherapy. Pretreatment characteristics, response to
              therapy and outcome of primary vs secondary APL were compared by
              standard statistical methods. Secondary APL constituted 12\% of
              all APL cases. Patients with secondary APL were significantly
              older (median age 56 vs 36 years; P < 0.01) and had a lower
              incidence of hypofibrinogenemia (P < 0.01) than those with
              primary APL. The complete response (CR) rates were similar with
              secondary vs primary APL (CR rates 79 vs 69\%), as were CR
              duration and survival. The CR rates at 5 years were 57 and 45\%,
              respectively(P not significant), and the survival rates 37 and
              35\%, respectively (P not significant). The incidence of
              secondary APL within APL disease (12\%) was similar to the
              incidence of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in karyotypes
              not known to be therapy-related (diploid, t(8;21), inversion 16:
              incidences 9 to 12\%), but was significantly lower than in
              karyotypes known to be therapy-related (chromosome 5 or 7
              abnormalities, 11q; incidences 30 and 33\%). We conclude that
              secondary APL has general characteristics and outcome similar to

              were measured in bone marrow blasts and plasma from acute
              promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. METHODS: The plasma
              variables were measured by ELISA or chromogenic study. The TF
              transcription was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase
              chain reaction technique (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The blast cell
              procoagulant activity (PCA), TF antigen of APL cell lysates, as
              well as the transcription of APL TF mRNA elevated at diagnosis,
              were reduced after ATRA or As2O3 therapy. The plasma level of

              consumption of anticoagulants as well as activation of
              coagulation and fibrinolytic system before treatment. Both ATRA
              and As2O3 therapy down-regulated the expression of TF mRNA,

  abstract = "Although Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) is now considered one
              of the most curable forms of acute leukemia, it is an aggressive
              disease associated with a high frequency of bleeding and
              thrombosis. Indeed, the leading cause of treatment failure in APL
              is not disease resistance or recurrence but death in induction by
              hemorrhage caused by APL-associated coagulopathy in which
              blast-derived pro-coagulant and fibrinolytic factors (Annexin A2
              and Tissue factor), as well as cytokines, microparticles and
              proteases were reported to participate of the pathogenesis.
              However, why some APL patients are more prone to develop bleeding
              diathesis than others is presently unknown. In order to address
              this issue, we performed microarray analysis of leukemic cells
              from 6 pairs of patients matched for age, sex, and WBC and
              platelet counts at diagnosis, but differed regarding the presence
              of clinical signs of APL-associated coagulopathy and fibrinogen
              levels (Table 1). All patients were enrolled in the IC-APL trial
              whose results have been reported \{Blood;121(11):1935-43\}.
              Clinical characteristics of the selected patients at the
              diagnosis of APL. Values represent the median and percentiles (25
              - 75) Bone marrow (BM) samples from the diagnosis, were submitted
              to red blood cell lysis (RBC Lysis solution, Qiagen), stabilized
              in TRIZOL (Invitrogen) at 1x106 cells/mL and stored at -800C. For
              RNA isolation we performed an extraction with chloroform and
              ethanol followed by a resin column method (where the DNAse
              treatment was made ''in column'') - ``Pure Link RNA Mini Kit''
              (Life Technologies). After quantification (Nanovue, GE
              Healthcare) the RNA samples were submitted to integrity analysis
              using the Bioanalyser system (Agilent). All samples presented a
              RNA integrity number (RIN) above 8, which attest the quality for
              microarray analysis. We used the Whole Human Genome Oligo
              Microarray Kit (Agilent, G4112F), which is a mRNA microarray
              slide with a content of more than 44.000 transcripts. A total of
              200ng of RNA from each sample was used and we followed the
              instructions of the manufacturer. The quality control for all
              hybridizations revealed a coefficient of variation of less than
              10\% and a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude. The
              identification of the differentially expressed transcripts was
              based on a modified T test that uses the fold change (FC) value
              as the variable and the experimental ``n'' and the variance to
              calculate the p value. Table 2 shows the main hyperexpressed
              genes in the BM samples from patients with severe APL
              coagulopathy. Main differently expressed genes (more expression
              in patients with coagulopathy) in bone marrow samples from the
              diagnosis of APL. The genes are ordered by fold change (FC). In
              patients with bleeding complications, molecules associated with
              endothelial activation or related to chemokines are on the top
              hyperexpressed genes ordered by FC. SELP works as an adhesion
              molecule of activated endothelial cells. GP1BA is a component of
              the receptor for von-Willebrand factor, which facilitate platelet
              adhesion to activated endothelium. IFI16, CXCL5 and IFNAR1 are
              related to inflammatory responses by chemokines, however there
              are no reports of their involvement in APL coagulopathy. Our
              results suggest that these factors are involved in the
              pathogenesis of APL coagulopathy. Additionally, further analysis
              using large and independent APL cohorts, may test the serum
              levels of interferon isoforms and CXCL5 as possible markers of
              risk. (Table Presented).",

              cif the Russian Federation, in March 2012 to May 2013, enrolled
              25 patients (13 men and 12 women) aged 29-72 years (median age 54
              years) with new-onset MM. The latter was staged using the
              Dune-Salmon classification: Stages I, II, and III were determined
              in 2, 10, and 13 patients, respectively. Seven patients were
              found to have renal dysfunction (which corresponded to Substage
              B). The hemostasis was evaluated from the results of the
              following tests: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),
              thrombin time (TT), Xlla-dependent fibrinolysis time, Quick
              prothrombin index, international normalized ratio (INR), and
              fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations. The investigators used new
              hemostatic techniques, such as thrombin generation test,
              thromboelastography, as well as thrombodynamics, a novel method
              to determine the characteristics of spatial clot growth.
              Induction therapy was performed using the PAD and VCD regimens.
              Thromboses were prevented by using 24-hour infusion of
              unfractionated heparin (500 U/hr) or by administering aspirin
              (100 mg/day). Results. Hypercoagulability was identified in 17
              (68\%) patients. Eleven (44\%) patients had elevated D-dimer
              concentrations. The level of D-dimer was statistically
              significantly positively correlated with the endogenous thrombin
              potential and the amount of beta(2)-microglobulin. The
              thrombodynamic technique revealed an inverse relationship between
              the level of paraprotein and the optimal density of a fibrin
              clot. A thrombotic episode was seen in one elderly (71-year-old)

              immobilization. Conclusion. Nearly 50\% of the primary patients
              with MM were ascertained to be more prone to thrombosis. Infusion
              of unfractionated heparin in a dose of 500 U/hr or administration

              to have sHLH. Five patients with acute leukemia had HLH at the

              were diagnosed as having sHLH during therapy (Group 1b), namely
              reactive sHLH associated with the chemotherapy. Nine patients,
              including two cases each of rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma,
              Hodgkin disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and one case with
              Langerhans cell histiocytosis, were diagnosed as having
              concomitant hemophagocytosis at the initial evaluation of the
              tumor (Group 2). Fever, anemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were
              present in all sHLH cases of all three groups. Hepatomegaly was
              detected in 60.0\%, 73.3\%, and 88.8\% of the three groups,
              respectively. Splenomegaly was more frequent in patients of
              Groups 1a (60.0\%) and 2 (88.8\%) than in those of Group 1b, the
              reactive ones (13.3\%). Hypofibrinogenemia was detected in all
              patients of Group 1a and Group 2. Low level of fibrinogen was
              present in 91.6\% of patients in Group 1b. All patients in Group
              1b (100\%) had neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia was
              found at rates of 60.0\% and 55.5\% in Group 1a and Group 2,
              respectively. Thrombocytopenia was detected in 80.0\% of patients
              in Group 1a and 77.7\% in Group 2. The overall mortality rate was
              34.4\% (10 cases) in our series of 29 children with sHLH; 50\% of
              deaths were directly attributable to HLH. Pediatric
              malignancy-associated HLH patients have been commonly described
              as case presentations or in a review of the literature. We
              believe that our cohort, compiling 29 children regarding the
              association between malignancy and HLH, will be useful for

              selected clinical and laboratory coagulation parameters during
              induction therapy were significantly associated with fatal
              hemorrhage in that week, or were predictive of fatal hemorrhage
              in the following week. The first six weeks of induction therapy
              were studied in 65 patients, during which time 23 patients (35\%)
              died from hemorrhagic complications. Time intervals analyzed were
              week 1, week 2, weeks 3 and 4, and weeks 5 and 6. There was no
              significant difference in the prevalence of severe
              hypofibrinogenemia (less than 150 mg\%), prolongation of the
              prothrombin time (greater than 14 s), or presence of infection

              did not, for any given time period. The most significant

              12(S)-HETE-binding complex was found to consist of subunits;
              raising the ATP concentration in cytosol led to conversion of the
              650 kDa complex to a 50 kDa binding component, presumably the
              actual 12(S)-HETE binding polypeptide. Lowering of the cytosolic
              concentration of ATP had the opposite effect, i.e., the amount of
              the 650 kDa complex increased. Another subunit of the 650 kDa
              complex was identified as heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) by

              count 8, patients received IVIg (1 to 2 g/kg) in combination with
              oral steroids. A good response was defined as the lowering of the
              initial bleeding score within 2 days after treatment initiation
              regardless of the platelet count. RESULTS: We applied this
              strategy for the management of 60 consecutive adults (mean age
              48+/-23 years) with AITP and a platelet count < or =20x10(9)/L/L
              (mean platelet count 6+/-5x10(9)/L/L). Based on this strategy,

              life-threatening bleeding occurred in patients treated with

              structural knowledge of the process of fibrin digestion,
              relationships between fibrin architecture and hypofibrinolysis
              remain controversial. To elucidate further structural and dynamic
              changes occurring during fibrinolysis, cross-linked plasma fibrin
              was labeled with colloidal gold particles, and fibrinolysis was
              followed by confocal microscopy. Morphological changes were
              characterized at fibrin network and fiber levels. The observation
              of a progressive disaggregation of the fibrin fibers emphasizes
              that fibrinolysis proceeds by transverse cutting rather than by
              progressive cleavage uniformly around the fiber. Plasma fibrin
              clots with a tight fibrin conformation made of thin fibers were
              dissolved at a slower rate than those with a loose fibrin
              conformation made of thicker (coarse) fibers, although the
              overall fibrin content remained constant. Unexpectedly, thin
              fibers were cleaved at a faster rate than thick ones. A dynamic
              study of FITC-recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
              distribution within the fibrin matrix during the course of
              fibrinolysis showed that the binding front was broader in coarse
              fibrin clots and moved more rapidly than that of fine plasma
              fibrin clots. These dynamic and structural approaches to fibrin
              digestion at the network and the fiber levels reveal aspects of
              the physical process of clot lysis. Furthermore, these results
              provide a clear explanation for the hypofibrinolysis related to a
              defective fibrin architecture as described in venous

              choice for patients with von Willebrand's disease and mild
              hemophilia A. This compound is also useful in other congenital
              and acquired disorders of hemostasis, reducing the need for blood
              derivatives with the inherent risks of infections and
              alloimmunization. The following article presents a pilot study on
              the safety and efficacy of desmopressin for the treatment or
              prevention of bleeding in 15 patients with thrombocytopenia
              associated with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Cases were
              consecutively recruited from February to June 1995. Fifteen
              patients were treated with desmopressin for prevention or
              treatment of bleeding. Desmopressin was diluted in 100 mL of
              isotonic saline and infused for 30 minutes. Bleeding time (BT)
              was carried out using the Simplate II device, making two
              standardized incisions on the forearm: the mean between the two
              incisions was recorded. RESULTS: Significant reduction of BT was
              observed in three out of four patients with myelodysplastic
              syndrome who were successfully treated for active bleeding or
              dental extraction. In the remaining patients, the effect of
              desmopressin on BT was not tested. Nevertheless, in all of them
              bleeding mainly due to epistaxis or persistent gum oozing was
              stopped by a single infusion of desmopressin. In three patients,
              desmopressin infusion had been successfully administered on a
              different occasion. No side effects were observed. INTERPRETATION
              AND CONCLUSIONS: Desmopressin could be a safe and immediately
              effective option for the treatment or prevention of bleeding in
              selected patients with hematologic malignancies.",

              (2) marked variability in the number and size of cytoplasmic
              granules, (3) dilatation of the open channel system, (4)
              cytoplasmic vacuolization, and (5) poorly delineated microtubular
              system. Metabolic defects included reduced cellular
              concentrations of ATP and ADP and selective reduction of the
              storage pool (non-metabolic) nucleotides. Stimulation of
              platelets was associated with delayed and incomplete granule

              Thrombocytopenia was the sole reason for the consultation. No
              previous thrombocytopenia had been recognized previously in any
              if these patients. The cause for thrombocytopenia was liver
              diease in 21 patients, sepsis in 12, immune (ITP) in 12,
              antimetabolites or antiseizure medications in 7, heparin induced

              acute progranulocytic leukemia (APL) in 3, rhabdomyolysis in 2,
              viral infections in 2, systemic lupus (SLE) in 2, and intravenous
              antibiotics in 2. The following conditions were each diagnosed
              once as the cause for thrombocytopenia:pregnancy, disseminated
              intravascular coagulation (DIC), post coronary bypass grafting,
              brain injury, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-M5),
              antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS), and intra aortic ballon pump.
              No diagnosis could be made in 13 patients. In 28 patients the
              initial diagnosis was incorrect. No diagnosis could be made in 13
              patients. In 6 patients two causes for thrombocytopenia were
              present. One patient was admitted twice with two different causes
              for thrombocytopenia (sepsis and ITP). Review of the peripheral
              smear is both necessary and mandatory. All three patients with
              APL were initially diagnosed with ITP, and the diagnosis of APL
              was not made until the smear was assessed. Smear review confirmed
              or made the diagnosis of TTP. Platelet clumping could not be made
              without reviewing the peripheral smear. Primary hematologic
              diagnoses (ITP, HIT, clumping, TTP, MDS, APL, AML, APLS) were
              present in 33 patients. Secondary causes for thrombocytopenia
              were present in the majority of patients. In summary

              and most patients will not have a primary hematologic etiology
              for the thrombocytopenia. Advanced liver disease is an
              underappreciated cause for thrombocytopenia and was never
              considered to be the cause for the thrombocytopenia by the
              referring physician. Despite exhaustive testing the cause for
              thrombocytopenia could not be made in 13 patients. However in
              these patients the platelet count rarely was below 100,000. The
              importance of reviewing the peripheral smear cannot be
              overemphasized.",

  author   = "Feoktistov, I and Biaggioni, I",
  abstract = "Adenosine receptors are present in platelets, and their
              activation results in accumulation of cAMP and inhibition of
              aggregation. The study of platelet adenosine receptors, however,
              is limited by the impossibility of maintaining these cells in
              vitro. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells express
              megakaryocytic/platelet markers and have been used as a model to
              study platelet receptors. Therefore, we sought to determine
              whether adenosine receptors were present in HEL cells. Adenosine
              agonists produced an accumulation of cAMP in HEL cells, implying
              the presence of A2 receptors. Xanthine and nonxanthine adenosine
              receptor antagonists blocked this effect in a simple competitive
              manner (Schild analysis). Therefore, both platelets and HEL cells
              possess A2 adenosine receptors. There were, however, significant
              differences between them. Adenosine agonists were, in general,
              less potent in HEL cells, compared with platelets. In particular,
              the adenosine analog CGS 21680, one of the most potent agonists
              in platelets, was virtually inactive in HEL cells. The orders of
              potencies for agonists (and their EC50 values for cAMP
              production) were 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (0.19 microM) =
              CGS 21680 (0.18 microM) > (R)-(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine
              (0.5 microM) in platelets and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (2.4
              microM) > (R)-(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (160 microM) >
              CGS 21680 (1600 microM) in HEL cells. In contrast to the
              decreased potency of agonists in HEL cells, the antagonist
              1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine was more potent in HEL
              cells, compared with platelets. Based on the striking differences
              in the rank orders of potencies of agonists and antagonists, we
              propose that HEL cells and platelets have different subtypes of
              adenosine A2 receptors. We found CGS 21680 particularly helpful
              in distinguishing between these receptor subtypes.",

              blood of 20 nontreated patients with acute myelogeneous leukaemia
              on normal platelet aggregation has been studied. The isolated
              blasts in concentration of 2,000$\mu$/l and higher, inhibit
              normal platelet aggregation induced by ADP or collagen, but have
              no influence on aggregation initiated by epinephrine. This effect
              is unaffected by the presence of metabolic poisons or by the

  abstract = "The standard methods for classifying acute leukaemias now include
              morphology, cytochemistry and membrane markers. Major advances in
              immunology, in particular the development of monoclonal
              antibodies (McAb) with lineage specificity, have provided
              objective positive criteria for the diagnosis of acute
              lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The FAB group has recognised the
              importance of McAb for the classification of some forms of acute
              myeloid leukaemia (AML), such as megakaryoblastic leukaemia,
              AML-M7, in which reactivity with McAb against platelet
              glycoproteins is a requirement for diagnosis. More recently the
              group has defined a type of myeloblastic leukaemia with minimal
              differentiation, AML-MO, in which myeloid cytochemistry is
              negative and the diagnosis is made by the expression of myeloid
              antigens and negative lymphoid markers in the blast cells.
              However, new problems have emerged with the wider use of McAb
              which now need to be addressed: the most important is the precise
              evaluation criteria for biphenotypic leukaemia for which we have
              proposed a scoring system in order to recognise the genuine cases
              which constitute a distinct disease entity. The role of
              karyotyping in the classification of acute leukaemia is gradually
              being defined (MIC proposals) and some forms of acute leukaemia
              can only be diagnosed by chromosome translocations, e.g. Ph+ ALL,
              resulting from t(9;22) and t(4;11) in infant ALL. Several
              translocations can also be demonstrated by molecular techniques.
              Cases with t(8;16) (p11;p13) are characterised by myelomonocytic
              features, erythrophagocytosis and fibrinolysis and represent a
              type of AML which can be defined primarily by its cytogenetic

              3.5 kilobases (kb), including the entire coding region of mature
              GPIIIa (2,286 basepairs, bp) and 1.3 kb of 3' untranslated

              (AML-M7) is difficult, requiring either specialized
              ultrastructural or immunologic techniques. Because the
              ultrastructural techniques are cumbersome, immunologic assays for
              expression of several platelet-specific antigens, such as CD41a
              (platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa), have become the primary method
              used to detect megakaryoblastic differentiation. In our flow
              cytometric analysis of the immunophenotypes of over 1,000 cases
              of AML from patients registered to Southwest Oncology Group
              (SWOG) Treatment Protocols, we found that 38\% of cases
              demonstrated CD41a reactivity. Because this frequency of CD41a
              expression by flow cytometry greatly exceeded the number of
              morphologically defined cases of AML-M7, we postulated that the
              reaction may be caused by platelets adherent to leukemic blasts.
              To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a side-by-side
              comparison of flow cytometric and cytospin immunofluorescence
              studies on 37 cases of adult de novo AML that demonstrated a wide
              range of CD41a expression by flow cytometric analyses. We found
              that the expression of CD41a detected by flow cytometric
              techniques was secondary to adherent platelets or platelet
              fragments in 85\% of cases. Many of these cases also expressed
              the lineage-specific carbohydrate, LNF III (CD15), which may
              mediate platelet adhesion to mature monocytes and neutrophils.
              Only 15\% of the CD41a flow cytometrically positive cases
              demonstrated true diffuse membrane and cytoplasmic positivity on
              cytospin slides indicative of megakaryoblastic differentiation.
              Cytospin immunofluorescence for CD41a should be performed on all
              cases of suspected AML-M7. If only flow cytometric techniques are
              used, adherent platelets may result in the erroneous diagnosis of

              use a 10 x 10(9)/L prophylactic platelet transfusion trigger
              (group A/8 centers) or a 20 x 10(9)/L trigger (group B/9

              membrane-lytic complex of complement and the rapid inactivation
              of thrombin by antithrombin III in the presence of heparin.
              Vitronectin is normally present in plasma at a concentration of
              approximately 300 micrograms/mL. The investigators quantified
              plasma vitronectin with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
              visualized reduced and nonreduced vitronectin by immunoblotting
              after separation of plasma or serum by sodium dodecyl
              sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The
              concentration of plasma vitronectin was markedly reduced in some
              patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, especially
              in those with liver failure; it was near normal in patients with
              metastatic cancer and acute leukemia. Patients with vitronectin
              levels less than 40\% normal invariably had low fibrinogen and
              antithrombin III and a prolonged prothrombin time. In both normal
              and patient plasmas there was heterogeneity in the ratio of the
              75,000- and 65,000-mol wt polypeptides of reduced vitronectin:
              18\% had mostly the 75,000-mol wt polypeptide, 59\% had roughly
              equal amounts of the two polypeptides, and 22\% had mostly the
              65,000-mol wt polypeptide. This polymorphism is inherited and
              appears to be due to two alleles that are present with
              approximately equal frequency. The blotting patterns of
              vitronectin in reduced and nonreduced plasmas were largely
              unaltered in plasma of patients with defibrination syndrome,
              fibrinolysis, liver failure, sepsis, metastatic cancer, and acute
              leukemia. There was no evidence of fragmentation of vitronectin
              or formation of the disulfide-bonded complex of vitronectin and
              thrombin-antithrombin III that is found when blood is clotted.
              Thus these results corroborate in vitro observations that the
              liver is the major source of plasma vitronectin, suggest that
              vitronectin may become depleted during disseminated intravascular
              coagulation, and define a genetic polymorphism of vitronectin.",

              factor (TF) and the hemostatic disorders, a series of parameters
              were measured in bone marrow blasts and plasma from acute
              promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. Methods: The plasma
              variables were measured by ELISA or chromogenic study. The TF
              transcription was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase
              chain reaction technique (RT-PCR). Results: The blast cell
              procoagulant activity (PCA), TF antigen of APL cell lysates, as
              well as the transcription of APL TF mRNA elevated at diagnosis,
              were reduced after ATRA or As2O3 therapy. The plasma level of
              platelet $\alpha$-granular membrane protein-140, soluble
              fibrinomonomer complex, thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen

              protein C activity and protein S remained elevated in ATRA group.
              Conclusions: There existed activation of platelets and
              consumption of anticoagulants as well as activation of
              coagulation and fibrinolytic system before treatment. Both ATRA
              and As2O3 therapy down-regulated the expression of TF mRNA,
              decreased the PCA and TF level in APL cells, inhibited
              coagulation activation, secondary hyperfibrinolysis and

  abstract = "Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments are
              increasingly used as outcome variables in clinical trials,
              leading to a requirement for sample size calculations based on
              these variables. This paper aims to provide a guide to sample
              size calculations for use with the EuroQol-5D. The paper focuses
              on sample sizes required for comparative studies, and uses scores
              from two reference groups of general population and critically
              ill patients to determine sample sizes using the three parts of
              the EQ-5D (descriptive system, visual analogue scale (VAS), and
              EQ-5D index). The effect on sample sizes of different methods of
              categorising the three variables are compared, and comparisons
              are also made between sample sizes using parametric and
              non-parametric methods. Sample sizes required when the EQ-5D
              descriptive system is used as a binary variable (problems/no
              problems) are higher than or equal to those required when each
              dimension is categorised in three levels of severity (no
              problems, moderate problems, extreme problems). The use of three
              categories is appropriate in ill populations, though in more
              healthy populations two categories should be used. Due to the
              slight skewness of VAS data, and the equality of results using
              parametric and non-parametric methods, sample size calculations
              using the VAS should be based on a parametric approach. Sample
              sizes were considerably higher for the EQ-5D index when
              predefined intervals, as opposed to a score frequency based
              categorisation, were used with the general population reference
              group. Using the EQ-5D index in ill populations, it is
              recommended that sample size calculations are based on parametric
              methods, whilst in healthier populations non-parametric methods
              should be used.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The threshold for prophylactic platelet
              transfusions has been classically established at 20,000/microL.
              In 48 patients with de novo acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) we
              analyzed the effect of reducing the threshold for prophylactic
              platelet transfusion from 20,000/microL (group A) to
              10,000/microL (group B) after induction and consolidation
              chemotherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-eight adult patients with
              de novo AML diagnosed in a single institution in a nine year
              period were enrolled in the study. Between January 1989 and
              December 1993 the patients received prophylactic platelet
              transfusions when their platelet count was below 20,000/microL
              (group A), and from January 1994 to March 1998 prophylactic
              platelet transfusions were indicated below 10,000/microL or
              between 10,000/microL and 20,000/microL if there was any
              consumption factor. RESULTS: The mean number (SD) of platelet
              transfusions during induction was 8.4 (5.3) in group A and 8.5
              (5.5) in group B; and during consolidation 4.7 (3.4) in group A
              and 4.6 (3.8) in group B (p = n.s.). Excluding the cases with
              consumption factors from the analysis, group B patients required
              34\% fewer transfusions during induction and 15.5\% fewer during
              consolidation (p = 0.04). There were no differences between
              groups regarding major bleeding episodes. INTERPRETATION AND
              CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the threshold for prophylactic
              platelet transfusion can be safely set at 10,000 microL during
              induction and consolidation chemotherapy for adult patients with

              indicate that ATRA treatment in vitro of the APL NB4 cell line
              can affect their procoagulant activity (PCA). To assess whether
              ATRA has this effect also in vivo, we prospectively studied the
              PCA of bone marrow blasts from APL patients on therapy with ATRA
              alone or associated with chemotherapy. Samples were obtained
              before, during, and after ATRA. To characterize the coagulopathy,
              we measured a series of plasma hemostatic variables before and
              during the first two weeks of therapy, as follows: (1) markers of
              hypercoagulability; (2) natural anticoagulants; (3) fibrinolysis
              proteins; and (4) elastase. The results by enzymatic and

              factor VII-independent (cancer procoagulant-like) blast cell
              PCAs, present before therapy, were reduced during (69\% and 65\%

              The plasma hemostatic assessment of patients before treatment was
              elevated hypercoagulability markers, low mean protein C, normal
              fibrinolysis proteins, and increased elastase. After starting
              ATRA, hypercoagulability markers were reduced within 4 to 8 days,
              protein C augmented, the overall fibrinolytic balance was
              unmodified, and elastase remained elevated. These results were
              not different either with or without chemotherapy and are

              Patients received two induction and two consolidation courses of
              intensively scheduled chemotherapy. Cytoreduction was assessed on
              day 14 and remission was assessed after courses 2 and 4. Bone

              course or after the first maintenance course and separated on a
              discontinuous percoll gradient before cryopreservation.
              Twenty-eight of 31 consecutively enrolled patients achieved CR.
              Three relapsed early and, of the 25 eligible, 24 underwent
              autologous BMT. Twenty- three patients received high-dose
              melphalan and 1 received busulphan and cyclophosphamide before

              25 months following autologous BMT only 3 children have relapsed.
              The 5-year event-free survival rate (EFS) from diagnosis is 68\%

              autologous BMT is 87\% (95\% confidence interval, 67\% to 100\%).
              Autologous BMT with high- dose melphalan administration after

  abstract = "We previously reported a study on fibrinolysis and
              fibrinogenolysis that analyzed fragments of fibrin/fibrinogen
              degradation products (FDP) using sodium dodecyl
              sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. In
              this report, we characterized the fragments of FDP in three
              patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
              associating with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). D, Y, DD,
              DY/X and high molecular weight fragments were observed in sera of
              all the patients obtained at the onset of APL. These results
              showed that various degrees of fibrinogenolysis, concomitant with
              fibrinolysis, was occurring in APL patients presenting DIC.
              However, changes in the patterns of the FDP fragments during
              anticoagulation therapy were apparently different among three
              patients. Namely, fibrinogenolysis was dominant in case 1, while
              fibrinolysis was dominant in case 2. Interestingly,
              fibrinogenolysis and fibrinolysis were almost equivalent from the
              onset to the end of DIC in case 3. In case 3, FDP and FDP-D dimer
              were remarkably elevated about two months before the onset of
              APL, although their elevation was not complicated with DIC but
              with bone marrow necrosis. At that time, serum LDH levels and
              plasma polymorphonuclear elastase (PMN-Ela) were increased
              presumably due to the release of these enzymes from necrotic bone
              marrow, and the levels of CRP and plasma fibrinogen were
              increased probably due to an infectious complication. In non-DIC
              period of case 3, FDP and FDP-D dimer were spontaneously
              decreased without reduction of PMN-Ela levels, after three weeks
              of chemotherapy for microbial agents. Taken together,
              characteristics of FDP fragments were unique to each case of
              APL-DIC, probably because many factors differently affected the
              degradation of fibrin and/or fibrinogen.",

              a large intervening sequence, and a C-terminal LIM domain and was
              identified as the human homolog of rat CLP36. The study showed
              that CLP36 associates with actin filaments and stress fibers that
              are formed during shape change and spreading of platelets and
              during migration and contraction of endothelial cells. CLP36
              binds to alpha-actinin-1 as shown by coimmunoprecipitation,
              pull-down experiments, yeast 2-hybrid analysis, and blot overlay
              assays and colocalizes with alpha-actinin-1 along endothelial
              actin stress fibers. In contrast to alpha-actinin-1, CLP36 was
              absent from focal adhesions in both activated platelets and
              endothelial cells. The N-terminal part of CLP36 containing the
              PDZ domain and the intervening region, but not the LIM domain,
              targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins to
              stress fibers in endothelial cells. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis
              demonstrated that the intervening sequence, but not the PDZ or
              the LIM domain of CLP36, binds to the spectrinlike repeats 2 and
              3 of alpha-actinin-1. The study further shows that CLP36 binds to
              alpha-actinin in resting platelets and translocates as a
              CLP36/alpha-actinin complex to the newly formed actin
              cytoskeleton in activated platelets. The results indicate that
              CLP36 binds via alpha-actinin-1 to actin filaments and stress
              fibers in activated human platelets and endothelial cells. The
              study suggests that CLP36 may direct alpha-actinin-1 to specific
              actin structures and at this position might modulate the function
              of alpha-actinin-1. (Blood. 2000;96:4236-4245)",

              (AML) is influenced by a multitude of factors. In this study we
              investigated whether hemorrhage in AML patients is associated
              with endothelial disruption, potentially caused by
              thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction and leukocytosis. In
              general, dysfunction of the inner lining of the vessel wall, the
              endothelium, contributes significantly to capillary leakage and
              bleeding and to the pathophysiology of systemic critical illness
              like sepsis and trauma. Trauma patients with excessive
              degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, have increased
              coagulopathy, bleeding and mortality. In AML patients, bleeding
              may also in part be attributed to direct activation and
              dysfunction of the endothelium, since leukemic blast cells and
              thrombocytopenia both activate or disrupts the endothelium.
              Design and Methods: All study patients were participants in a
              previous prospective study of functional platelet defects and
              hemorrhage. Patients were diagnosed with AML according to the
              WHO-classification, and enrolled in the study at the time of
              diagnosis before onset of treatment. In the present study, 49
              patients with available serum or plasma samples from the original
              cohort were included. We measured soluble markers of glycocalyx
              degradation and endothelial cell activation and damage
              (syndecan-1, Inter Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1),
              sE-selectin, thrombomodulin (sTM)), natural anticoagulation
              (protein C), platelet activation (sCD40L) and cell turn-over
              (histone complexed DNA (hcDNA)) along with previously collected
              data on bleeding status and platelet activation markers (CD62P,
              CD63, PAC-1) before and after thrombin receptor agonist peptide
              (TRAP) stimulation. Hemorrhage was evaluated according to the
              Common Toxicity Criteria on a 0-4 scale and performed by the same
              physician in 47 patients. Results: Median age was 67 years (IQR:
              51-74) and 41\% (n=20) were female. Twenty three patients (47\%)
              had no bleeding (grade 0), whereas 22 (45\%) and 4 (8\%) patients
              experienced bleeding according to group 1 and 2 classification
              respectively. No patients suffered from grade 3 or 4 bleeding.
              Patients with bleeding (group 1 and 2) had, as expected, lower
              platelet count (median: 22 (IQR: 17-45) vs. 92 (38-153) mia/L)
              but also had higher circulating levels of syndecan-1 (46 (30-102)
              vs. 27 (21-57) ng/mL) and sICAM-1 (384 (293-553) vs. 264
              (193-376) ng/mL) indicating increased endothelial glycocalyx
              degradation and endothelial cell activation. Also, bleeding
              patients had lower TRAP-stimulated CD62P and CD63 platelet
              expression, indicating impaired platelet function. Leukocyte
              count (blast count) correlated positively with syndecan-1,
              sE-selectin and sTM, suggesting that the degree of glycocalyx
              degradation and endothelial cell activation and damage was
              related to the number of circulating blasts. Patients with
              endothelial glycocalyx degradation, evidenced by syndecan-1 level
              $\geq$ median, had more bleeding (16 vs. 9 patients) and reduced
              TRAP-stimulated CD62P expression despite comparable platelet
              counts. These patients were older (70 (63-78) vs. 58 (47-71)
              years), displayed signs of profound endothelial cell activation
              and damage, evidenced by higher levels of ICAM-1 (361 (300-502)
              vs. 255 (198-389) ng/mL) and sTM (4.1 (3.5-5.4) vs. 1.8 (1.5-2.5)
              ng/mL), and had higher leukocyte count (25 (3-89) vs. 5 (2-18)
              mia/L) (all p< 0.05). Conclusions: High syndecan-1 levels in AML
              patients are associated with bleeding, impaired platelet
              function, higher age, endothelial cell activation and damage, and
              leukocytosis. These findings identify new aspects of the vascular
              pathophysiology of bleeding in AML, and we suggest that platelet
              dysfunction and leukocytosis may contribute to the endothelial
              disruption. In the future, interventions designed to stabilize
              the endothelium and prevent endothelial degradation may reduce
              the risk of fatal hemorrhage in AML patients.",

  abstract = "The bleeding diathesis in patients with acute promyelocytic
              leukemia (APL) is generally attributed to disseminated
              intravascular coagulation (DIC), initiated by the release of
              procoagulant activity from leukemic cells. Primary
              fibrinogenolysis, mediated by the release of leukocyte proteases,
              may also contribute to this disorder. We analyzed coagulation
              parameters in 15 non-septic APL patients. Before treatment, there
              was evidence of thrombin activation with DIC: increased levels of
              circulating thrombin-antithrombin III complexes, prothrombin
              fragments 1 + 2 and D-Dimer complexes. This DIC syndrome was
              probably limited, since no prothrombin time decrease, no
              significant factor V consumption, and normal levels of
              coagulation inhibitors (antithrombin III and protein C) were
              observed in APL patients when compared to normal controls. In
              this context, marked hypofibrinogenemia suggested primary
              fibrinogenolysis as the predominant etiology. Despite normal or
              high tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator
              inhibitor (PAI-1) antigen levels, the plasma PAI-1 activity and
              the formation of tPA/PAI-1 complexes were lower in APL patients
              than in normal controls, suggesting a proteolytic degradation of
              PAI-1, not able to complex tPA. Two other fibrinolytic inhibitor
              molecules (alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor antigen and histidine-rich
              glycoprotein antigen) were also significantly reduced, as well as
              the two subunits of fibrin stability factor XIII, although only
              subunit A is known to be susceptible to thrombin action. Evidence
              of degraded forms of von Willebrand factor in the plasma
              suggested an extended proteolytic activity. Four patients treated
              with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) as a single differentiating
              agent were studied serially. A dissociation between these two
              syndromes--DIC and fibrinogenolysis/proteolysis--was observed.
              The rapid correction of the lysis markers contrasted with a more
              prolonged persistence of the procoagulant activity. We observed
              persistently high elastase/alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor complex
              levels during ATRA therapy, despite progressive correction of all
              lysis markers. Thus, the release of elastase from promyelocytic
              leukemic cells is probably not the only determinant of the
              fibrinogenolytic/proteolytic syndrome. In summary, the present
              findings provide new arguments for the association of DIC and
              proteolysis syndromes in APL-associated coagulation disorders.
              Further prospective studies are needed in order to confirm the
              persistence of thrombin activation in course of ATRA therapy.",

              mycoplasmal infections",
  author   = "Taylor-Robinson, D and B{\'e}b{\'e}ar, C",
  abstract = "Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living microorganisms, being
              about 300 nm in diameter. They are bounded by a triple-layered
              membrane and, unlike conventional bacteria, do not have a rigid
              cell wall. Hence, they are not susceptible to penicillins and
              other antibiotics that act on this structure. They are, however,
              susceptible to a variety of other broad-spectrum antibiotics,
              most of which only inhibit their multiplication and do not kill
              them. The tetracyclines have always been in the forefront of
              antibiotic usage, particularly for genital tract infections, but
              macrolides are also widely used for respiratory tract infections.
              Indeed, in comparison with the tetracyclines, erythromycin, the
              newer macrolides, the ketolides and the newer quinolones have
              equal or sometimes greater activity. The two latter antibiotic
              groups also have some cidal activity. The antibiotic
              susceptibility profiles of several mycoplasmas of human origin
              are presented, those of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma
              genitalium being similar. Apart from the penicillins, mycoplasmas
              are innately resistant to some other antibiotics, for example the
              rifampicins. In addition, some may develop resistance, either by
              gene mutation or by acquisition of a resistance gene, to
              antibiotics to which they are usually sensitive. Resistance of
              mycoplasmas to tetracyclines is common and due to acquisition of
              the tetM gene. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern may be
              influenced greatly by the source of the mycoplasma; for example,
              one recovered from a contaminated eukaryotic cell culture that
              has been subjected to extensive antibiotic treatment may have an
              antibiotic profile quite different from the same mycoplasmal
              species that has been recovered directly from a human or animal
              source. Mycoplasmas may be difficult to eradicate from human or
              animal hosts or from cell cultures by antibiotic treatment
              because of resistance to the antibiotic, or because it lacks
              cidal activity, or because there is invasion of eukaryotic cells
              by some mycoplasmas. Eradication may be particularly difficult in
              immunosuppressed or immunodeficient individuals, particularly
              those who are hypogammaglobulinaemic. The regimes that are most
              likely to be effective in the treatment of respiratory or
              genitourinary mycoplasmal infections are presented.",

              evidence supporting prophylactic platelet transfusions is
              limited, and there are very few studies that have examined the
              dose for prophylactic platelet transfusions. Review of the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Most patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
              suffer from disordered hemostasis. We have previously shown that
              annexin II (Ann II), a high-affinity co-receptor for
              plasminogen/tissue plasminogen activator, plays a central role in
              primary hyperfibrinolysis in patients with acute promyelocytic
              leukemia (APL). The expression of Ann II in cells from patients
              with major subtypes of AML and the effect of arsenic trioxide
              (As2O3) on Ann II expression in AML cells were investigated to
              determine whether As2O3-mediated downregulation of Ann II could
              restore hemostatic stability. METHODS: A total of 103 patients
              (48 females and 55 males; age, 19 - 58 years) were included.
              Plasma samples were collected before and after treatment as well
              as after complete remission. Ann II and plasminogen activation
              were measured in leukemic cells during treatment with 1
              micromol/L As2O3. RESULTS: Before As2O3 treatment, Ann II mRNA
              expression (real-time PCR) was the highest in M3 cells (P <
              0.05), higher in M5 cells than that in M1, M2, M4, and M6 cells
              (P < 0.001), and positively correlated with Ann II protein
              expression (flow cytometry) (r = 0.752, P < 0.01). Exposure for
              up to 120 hours to As2O3 (1 micromol/L) had no significant effect
              on Ann II protein in M1 and M2 leukemic cells, but decreased Ann
              II protein expression twofold within 48 hours of exposure in M3
              cells (P < 0.05) and twofold within 96 hours in M5 cells (P <
              0.05). The rate of plasmin generation was higher in APL, M5, and
              M4 cells than in M1, M2, and M6 cells. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 may
              reduce hyperfibrinolysis in AML by downregulation of Ann II.
              Furthermore, As2O3 affects more than one form of AML (APL, M4 and
              M5), suggesting its potential role in their management.",

              fibrinolysis parameters during the induction phase of the
              antileukemic treatment. Sixty-four children were classified by

              during induction treatment of ALL including four weeks of
              dexamethasone, followed by two weeks tapering of dexamethasone
              during which 6,000 IU/m(2) native L-Asparaginase (total 4 doses)
              was administered intravenously twice weekly. Blood samples were
              collected immediately before each L-Asparaginase infusion to
              analyze procoagulant (fibrinogen, factor [F] II, FV, FVII, F IX,
              F X) and anticoagulant factors (antithrombin [AT], protein C,

              fibrinolysis (alpha2-antiplasmin, plasminogen, PAP, D-dimer).
              Children were in a hypercoagulable state after four weeks of
              dexamethasone due to upregulation of coagulation parameters.
              Upregulation was highest in the two youngest age groups. During
              L-Asparaginase treatment the 11- to 16-year-olds showed lower

              levels compared to the younger children. Activation markers of
              thrombin generation and fibrinolysis did not change over time

              alpha2-antiplasmin and plasminogen during L-Asparaginase
              treatment resulted in less potential of clot lysis by plasmin in
              children older than 11 years of age. In conclusion, a more severe
              decline of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic parameters in children
              between 11 and 16 years of age underline that these children are
              at higher risk of thrombosis during ALL induction treatment.",

              treatment. METHODS: Plasma fibrinogen concentration was
              determined with the conventional method, and the levels of fibrin
              degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer were quantified with
              ELISA. Plasminogen was measured by chromogenic assay. Cell
              surface expression of Annexin II and u-PAR and their mRNA levels
              were measured by flow cytometry and real time-PCR, respectively.
              RESULTS: The levels of FDP and D-dimer in APL were remarkably
              higher in APL patients than that in normal controls, while
              fibrinogen and plasminogen were lower. Both Annexin II and u-PAR

              analogue [33P]2MeSADP as a specific P2T radioligand. ADP and
              2MeSADP were able to induce shape change and pseudopod formation

  abstract = "Embedded Image INTRODUCTION Mast cell disease is a clonal
              haematological disorder resulting in organ infiltration by mast
              cells and uncontrolled degranulation (mast cell activation
              syndrome, MCAS). Although not characteristic and poorly
              explained, both primary (platelet's adhesion and aggregation) and
              secondary (coagulation cascade leading to thrombin formation)
              clotting abnormalities are observed among some patients. METHODS
              We retrospectively identified patients with established diagnosis
              of mastocytosis and related clotting abnormalities (clinical
              and/or biological) using the French National Reference Centre for
              Mastocytosis database. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Our cohort included
              14 adult patients (median age of 42 [range 26-78] years, sex
              ratio 3.7, CKIT D816V in 13/14 cases, median tryptase of 200
              [4-1240] ng/mL). Four patients had typical symptoms and/or
              clotting tests (PFA, von Willebrand's disease [vWD] screening)
              indicating abnormalities of primary haemostasis [Table, patient
              1], with n=1 confirmed and n=2 highly suspicious of vWD. They
              presented with either nil (n=1) or mild (n=3) mucocutaneous
              bleeding. This could be due to heparin binding to von
              Willebrand's factor, therefore preventing platelet aggregation.
              Ten patients had abnormalities of coagulation cascade (prolonged
              PT, aPTT, reduced clotting factors II, V, VII, X), usually
              transient but with bleeding in 7 cases (severe/life-threatening
              in 5 of them ) [Table, patient 3]. Clotting abnormalities were
              typically accompanied by anaphylactoid symptoms of MCAS and
              increased by the presence of hematopoietic organ infiltration
              [Table, patients 2-4]. Haemostatic management (red blood cells
              and platelets transfusion, fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K,
              antifibrinolytic) was unsuccessful, while control of mast cell
              activity (e.g. with and steroids) would achieve haemostasis,
              indicating the crucial role of mast cell mediators. These mainly
              include tryptase and heparin, which inhibit the intrinsic
              pathway, inducing an anticoagulant state. The exact prevalence of
              clotting abnormalities in mastocytosis remains unclear and
              probably underestimated. However, we found a predominance of
              aggressive types of mastocytosis in the population with
              coagulation cascade abnormalities: 50\% had aggressive systemic
              mastocytosis associated or not with a clonal haematological non
              mast cell lineage disease (ASM/AHNMD), 30\% had mast cell
              leukaemia (MCL). All deceased patients (n=5, 36\% of the overall
              population) belonged to this group. In contrast, mastocytosis was
              indolent in 75\% of cases in the group with primary haemostasis
              abnormalities. (Table Presented) CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
              Blood coagulation abnormalities in mastocytosis appear secondary
              to a hyperactivity of the clonal mast cell, resulting in an
              anticoagulant state and typically presenting in the context of
              MCAS and/or significant mast cell proliferation. They are
              particularly prevalent in aggressive types of mastocytosis, and
              are only successfully controlled by mast cell inhibitors, notably
              steroids. More data are required to better correlate clinical and
              biological pictures, and to assess whether standard or specific
              clotting tests could be used as a marker of mast cell activity
              and potentially of poor prognosis in patients with systemic
              mastocytosis.",

              METHODS: The fibrinolytic activity was measured by chromogenic
              assay in NB4, SHI-1, K562, Jurkat and Raji cell lines. The
              protein expression of uPAR and Annexin II on cells surface and
              the mRNA expression of uPAR and Annexin II in cells of these cell
              lines were detected using flow cytometry and RT-PCR method

              increased significantly after incubation of SHI-1 and NB4 cells
              with plasminogen. The plasmin activity of NB4 cells was obviously
              decreased by ATRA. The plasmin activity of NB4 and SHI-1 cells
              was significantly decreased by uPAR monoclonal antibodies. The
              expressions of uPAR and Annexin II and their mRNA in SHI-1 and

              their mRNA in NB4 cells. CONCLUSION: In leukemia cell lines, NB4
              and SHI-1 cells have stronger fibrinolytic activity. Both Annexin
              II and uPAR on the leukemic cell membranes might contribute to
              this activity. The high fibrinolytic activity can be corrected by

              Haplodeficiency of RUNX1 is associated with familial
              thrombocytopenia, impaired platelet function and
              megakaryopoiesis, and predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia.
              Platelet abnormalities include impaired aggregation, secretion,
              protein phosphorylation, and activation of GPIIb-IIIa on platelet
              activation. Dense granule deficiency, either alone or in
              combination with alpha granule deficiency, has been reported in
              patients with RUNX1 haplodeficiency, but the mechanisms involved
              are unknown. We have reported a patient with inherited
              thrombocytopenia and abnormal platelet function (Gabbeta et al,
              Blood 87:1368-76, 1996) associated with a heterozygous nonsense
              mutation in transcription factor RUNX1 (Sun et al, Blood 103:
              948-54, 2004). The platelets showed impaired aggregation, dense
              granule secretion, phosphorylation of pleckstrin and myosin light
              chain, diminished GPIIb-IIIa activation and decreased platelet
              protein kinase C-$\vartheta$. Platelet mRNA expression profiling
              showed downregulation of several genes, including myosin light
              chain 9 (MYL9), platelet factor 4 (PF4), protein kinase
              C-$\vartheta$ (PRKB), and 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) in the patient
              compared to 6 normal subjects (Sun et al, J. Thromb Haemost. 5:
              146-54, 2007). (We have shown that these genes are direct
              transcriptional targets of RUNX1.) In addition, PLDN, which
              encodes for protein pallidin, was four-fold down-regulated in
              platelets (fold change 0.239, p=0.029). In mouse model pallid,
              knock out of pldn leads to dense granule deficiency. Recent
              reports document mutations in PLDN in human subjects with
              platelet dense granule deficiency and the Hermansky-Pudlak
              syndrome. Pallidin is one of 8 subnunits that constitute the
              BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1),
              which plays a major role in granule/vesicle biogenesis. PLDN has
              two known human transcripts; PLDN1 is expressed ubiquitously,
              with exception of brain, while PLDN2 is expressed in brain,
              testes and leukocytes. We have addressed that PLDN is a direct
              transcriptional target of RUNX1 and hypothesize that its
              decreased expression constitutes a mechanism for the platelet
              dense granule deficiency in patients with RUNX1 haplodeficiency.
              We validated the decreased expression of PLDN on platelet
              profiling by quantitative real-time PCR - PLDN1 mRNA expression
              was decreased by 16-fold in the patient relative to normal
              subjects. We studied the regulation of PLDN1 by RUNX1 in human
              erythroleukemia (HEL) cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate
              13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h to induce megakaryocytic
              transformation. In silico analyses revealed the presence of 6
              RUNX1 consensus binding sites in 2288bp of PLDN1 5' upstream
              region from ATG. To determine endogenous interaction of RUNX1
              with PLDN promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
              (ChIP) assay using anti-RUNX1 antibody. There was RUNX1 binding
              to PLDN chromatin at regions encompassing the putative RUNX1
              binding site 1 (-184 to -179 bp) and site 3 (-1370/-1365 bp). We
              performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using
              probes with RUNX1 motifs and PMA-treated HEL cell nuclear
              extracts. With 30-34 bp probes encompassing site 1 (-184 to -179
              bp) and site 3 (-1370 to -1365 bp), protein binding was observed
              that was competed by excess unlabelled probe and inhibited by
              anti-RUNX1 antibody indicating RUNX1 as the protein involved. To
              study the functional effect of the binding sites, the wild type
              PLDN1 promoter construct -2288/-2 bp containing the putative
              RUNX1 sites or mutant constructs with each site individually
              mutated were cloned into firefly luciferase reporter gene vector
              and transfected into HEL cells. Mutation of RUNX1 sites 1 and 3
              individually caused 60-70\% reduction in promoter activity
              indicating that these sites were functional. Studies on the other
              RUNX1 consensus sites in PLDN promoter are underway. Conclusions
              Our results provide the first evidence that PLDN gene is
              transcriptionally regulated by and is a direct target of RUNX1.
              These studies provide a cogent mechanism for the PLDN transcript
              downregulation observed in the patient platelets. More
              importantly, they provide a mechanism for the dense granule
              deficiency and impaired vesicle formation associated with RUNX1
              haplodeficiency.",

              patients affected with blastic leukaemia, in 16 patients with
              blastic crisis in chronic myeloid leukaemia and in 2 patients
              with Willebrand's syndrome. The real activity of FP4 determined
              by modifying the method according to NIEWIAROWSKI after a
              complete lysis of granular membrances by means of triton X-100
              was found to be lowered in 9 patients affected with blastic
              leukaemia, in 5 patients with blastic crisis and in two patients
              with Willebrand's syndrome. Presuming that a maximal FP4 release
              of the irreversible platelet aggregation must be obtained, which
              corresponds to the real activity, the author has examined the
              apparent activity of FP4 released from the aggregated platelets
              with the help of her own method. In this way the quality of the
              release reaction from the platelets can indirectly be
              characterized with their extremely important role for
              haemostasis. Whereas in exacerbated myeloid leukaemia and
              Willebrand's syndrome the apparent activity will correspond to
              the real one, there is a severe specific disturbance of the
              platelet release response in blastic leukaemia. The platelet
              aggregation is incomplete caused by the derailment of the energy
              metabolism and the disturbance of the adenine nucleotides, thus
              causing an apparent as well as a real FP4 deficiency which can be
              brought into the same line with pathogenesis of thrombopathy in
              blastic leukaemia.",

              phosphorus determination showed no significant alterations in
              phospholipid composition of HL60 cells during differentiation.
              Together these data are suggestive that mechanisms regulating the

              are defective in uninduced cells and that an increased

              acute myeloid leukemia (AML) present severe alterations of
              platelet function. Platelets from these patients are dysplastic
              and have alterations in membrane and granular content. Aim The
              purpose of this study was to identify abnormalities in platelet
              function and a possible correlation with changes in platelet
              membrane fluidity and the reactive species level. Material and
              method We present a prospective study on 73 cases with MDS
              compared with 33 cases with AML admitted in University Emergency
              Hospital Bucharest. Three patients with AML were investigated in
              early stages and the phase of complete remission of the disease.
              Platelet function was investigated by platelet aggregation using
              as stimuli ADP, collagen, epinephrine and ristocetin. Membrane
              fluidity was assessed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements
              using TMA-DPH, the ROS level determination was performed using
              DCFDA method. Results. Platelet aggregation was altered in both
              groups of patients, more pronounced for AML patients. (AML vs.
              MDS: ADP 28.10 vs. 37.88, p=0.009; collagen 40.69 vs. 58.37,
              p=0.003; epinephrine vs. 16.48 24.16, p=0.14; ristocetin 43.73
              vs. 50, p=0.37). No significant differences were obtained in the
              lag phase in the two groups of patients. The platelet aggregation
              response was improved in remission phase of AML for all reagents
              .The membrane anisotropy was increased in AML patients compared
              with MDS patients(r = 0.1711 vs. 0. 1372, p = 0.002), this result
              correspond to low fluidity of membrane. There was not obtained a
              statistically significant correlation between the degree of
              membrane anisotropy and severity platelet function. Reactive
              species level is slightly higher in AML patients (0.0005280 vs.
              0.0004051, p = 0.52). This level is significantly increased in
              advanced phase of disease.(LAM patients 0.0006078 vs. 0.0001413,
              p= 0.003; MDS patients 0.0005452 vs. 0.0001804, p=0.005). We
              could not establish a correlation of the fluidity changes
              depending on the level of ROS. Conclusion. AML patients have an
              advanced degree of alteration of platelet function and a low
              fluidity of platelet membranes compared to MDS patients.
              Achieving a clinical remission may improve platelet function,
              possibly due to a more appropriate expression of platelet
              receptors and / or improving cellular signaling, possibly
              correlated with low levels of reactive species.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a serious
              complication of acute leukemia, and the underlying conditions are
              different from the common risk factors for CVD. The aim of this
              study was to characterize the clinical and pathological features
              of CVD in patients with acute leukemia. PATIENTS OR MATERIALS: In
              our series of 116 autopsied cases of acute leukemia during the
              period between January 1978 and December 1998, we had 14 patients
              who had CVD during the course of acute leukemia. The
              neuropathological and clinical features of those patients were
              examined. RESULTS: Neuropathological examination showed
              hemorrhagic infarction due to disseminated aspergillosis or
              mucormycosis (5 cases), multiple hemorrhages due to leukemic cell
              infiltration (2 cases) and a single massive hemorrhage with
              petechial hemorrhages in various regions of the brain (4 cases).
              Three patients had CVD due to miscellaneous causes.
              Clinicopathological correlation revealed that fungal
              disseminations occurred under agranulocytosis, while leukemic
              cell infiltration occurred under a marked leukocyotosis
              (peripheral white blood cell count >100,000/microl). Four
              patients with coagulopathy, including three with disseminated
              intravascular coagulation (DIC) had a single massive hemorrhage.
              CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that there were at least three
              types of CVD with specific clinicopathological features.
              Hemorrhagic infarction under agranulocyotosis was due to
              disseminated aspergillosis or mucormycosis. Multiple cerebral
              hemorrhages under marked leukocyotosis was due to leukemic cell
              infiltration into the brain. Massive cerebral hemorrhage was
              associated with coagulopathy including DIC.",

              thrombocytopenia to values making possible aggregation tests, and
              platelet separation from the influence of plasma factors. Then
              aggregation of isolated platelets caused by ADP was studied. In
              16 out of 22 patients a fall of aggregation was observed, with
              the mean values of aggregation rate and intensity were

              remove the leukocytes from the platelet concentrates by

              concentrates are treated with 50 ng/mL prostacyclin to inactivate
              the platelets transiently. The concentrates are then passed
              through a cellulose-acetate filter to remove the leukocytes. In
              30 concentrates this treatment reduced the contamination by
              leukocytes to less than 0.1 million per concentrate with a

              risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism. Formation of denser
              and poorly lysable fibrin clots is observed in patients with
              arterial and venous thromboembolism. Aims: We investigated fibrin
              clot properties and their treatmentinduced alterations in
              MMpatients. Patients and Methods: Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot
              permeability, turbidity and susceptibility to lysis induced by
              recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) were
              evaluated in 106 MM patients (55 men and 51 women aged 34-85
              years), vs. 100 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients on
              thromboprophylaxis with aspirin or heparins were eligible. The
              patients were evaluated prior to and following 3 months of
              induction therapy, mainly using thalidomide-based regimens.
              Results: MM patients had lower clot permeability (-34\%),
              compaction (+34\%), indicating denser fibrin clots, impaired
              fibrin polymerization with longer lag phase (+20\%) and lower
              final turbidity (-25\%), combined with hypofibrinolysis reflected
              by longer clot lysis time (t50\%, -24\%) and slower rate of
              D-dimer release from fibrin clots (D-Drate,-10\%) compared with
              controls (all P < 0.001). Maximum Ddimer levels released from
              clots (D-Dmax) were elevated by 24.3\% in the patients compared
              to controls (P < 0.001). Patients with IgG MM had lower clot
              permeability compared with IgA MM (5.9 [5.1-6.4] vs. 6.3
              [5.9-7.2] 10 -9 cm2; P = 0.007). The MM patients had higher peak
              thrombin concentration (+63.5\%), thrombin-activatable
              fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activity (+32.9\%), plasminogen
              activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity (+56.6\%) and FVIII
              (+72.3\%, all P < 0.01). Clot permeability in MM patients was
              associated with peak thrombin generation (r = -0.63, P < 0.001),
              PAI-1 activity (r = -0.57, P < 0.001) and TAFI activity (r =
              -0.58, P < 0.001), but not with fibrinogen. Similar but positive
              associations were observed for clot lysis time. Scanning electron
              microscopy confirmed abnormal clot morphology. A 3-month therapy
              resulted in improved clot properties observed in 48 MM (45.3\%)
              patients in whom blood samples were available (all P < 0.01).
              Clot permeability and compaction increased (+10\% and +16.7\%,
              respectively). Fibrinolysis was accelerated (t50\% by 7.8\% and
              D-Drate by 7.5\%). Posttreatment absorbancy of a fibrin gel
              increased (+19.7\%) and lag phase became shorter (-5.9\%).
              Posttreatment clot permeability and lysis time remained
              significantly associated with peak thrombin generation, PAI-1
              activity and TAFI activity (all P < 0.01). Thromboembolism (n =
              12, venous thromboembolism, n = 10) observed in 12 patients
              during induction treatment despite thromboprophylaxis (nine
              patients received low-dose ASA, three were on prophylactic
              heparin) were associated with reduced clot permeability (-8.4\%),
              higher D-Dmax (+13.3\%), lower D-Drate (-9\%) and 20\% longer lag
              phase at baseline (all P < 0.05). Thromboembolism in MM patients
              was associated with higher baseline peak thrombin concentration
              (+18.9\%), TAFI activity (+20.8\%) and PAI-1 activity (+37.5\%)
              together with slightly lower plasminogen (-7.8\%; all P < 0.05).
              Conclusion: Substantial prothrombotic alterations of fibrin clot
              properties occur in patients with MM. More compact fibrin clots
              with reduced lysability characterize subjects who experienced
              thrombotic complications during induction treatment. Our findings
              show a new prothrombotic mechanism in MMand its determinants.",

              stimulated by thrombin receptor-activating peptide, an increase
              in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) developed as predicted by the known
              effect that thrombin exerts in the platelet. We then monitored
              the membrane potentials of individual DAMI cells during this
              response and observed complex, triphasic changes that could not
              be accounted for by Ca2+ fluxes alone. These consisted of rapid
              hyperpolarization, followed by depolarization to values more
              positive than the resting potential and then by slow
              repolarization. For the purpose of this study, we focused on the
              hyperpolarizing current that developed immediately after thrombin
              receptor activation. This proved to be composed of (1) a
              Ca2+-independent, outwardly rectifying Cl- current and (2) a
              strongly hyperpolarizing, inwardly rectifying, Ba2+-sensitive K+
              current that required an increase of [Ca2+](i) for activation. By
              analogy with their functions in other cell systems, it is logical
              to conclude that these prominent K+ and Cl- conductances may
              serve to regulate the complex volume changes that accompany
              thrombin receptor activation and/or to increase the electromotive

              S (PS) in 13.5\% of patients. Distribution between the free and
              the bound PS fraction remained normal. The most frequent
              abnormality found was the reduction of plasminogen (PLG)
              activity, which was observed in 35.1\% and elevated levels of
              plasminogen activator inhibitor, detected in 42.3\% of cases,
              respectively. Decreased plasminogen activator activity was
              observed in only one patient. The relationship between isotype
              and concentration of paraprotein and frequency of factor levels
              abnormalities was not found. The incidence of arterial and/or
              venous thrombosis was higher in patients with laboratory defect

              (AML-M7) is difficult, requiring either specialized
              ultrastructural or immunologic techniques. Because the
              ultrastructural techniques are cumbersome, immunologic assays for
              expression of several platelet-specific antigens, such as CD41a
              (platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa), have become the primary method
              used to detect megakaryoblastic differentiation. In our flow
              cytometric analysis of the immunophenotypes of over 1,000 cases
              of AML from patients registered to Southwest Oncology Group
              (SWOG) Treatment Protocols, we found that 38\% of cases
              demonstrated CD41a reactivity. Because this frequency of CD41a
              expression by flow cytometry greatly exceeded the number of
              morphologically defined cases of AML-M7, we postulated that the
              reaction may be caused by platelets adherent to leukemic blasts.
              To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a side-by-side
              comparison of flow cytometric and cytospin immunofluorescence
              studies on 37 cases of adult de novo AML that demonstrated a wide
              range of CD41a expression by flow cytometric analyses. We found
              that the expression of CD41a detected by flow cytometric
              techniques was secondary to adherent platelets or platelet
              fragments in 85\% of cases. Many of these cases also expressed
              the lineage-specific carbohydrate, LNF III (CD15), which may
              mediate platelet adhesion to mature monocytes and neutrophils.
              Only 15\% of the CD41a flow cytometrically positive cases
              demonstrated true diffuse membrane and cytoplasmic positivity on
              cytospin slides indicative of megakaryoblastic differentiation.
              Cytospin immunofluorescence for CD41a should be performed on all
              cases of suspected AML-M7. If only flow cytometric techniques are

              promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in the absence of severe infection,
              marked fibrinolysis was noted in comparison with normal levels of
              antithrombin III, which is a major inhibitor of the coagulation
              system. Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
              antigen levels in plasma from patients with septicemia decreased
              the ratio of the plasma clot lysis rate induced by an anti-alpha
              2-plasmin inhibitor monoclonal antibody to the tissue-type
              plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration. This decrease was not
              as prominent in plasma from patients with DIC, especially those
              with APL. To explore the character of PAI-1 in these plasmas, we
              measured the specific activity of PAI-1 by determining the ratio
              of active PAI-1 antigen to t-PA-unbound PAI-1 antigen. To
              calculate the amount of active PAI-1 antigen, the amount of
              t-PA/PAI-1 complex before and after the addition of a fixed
              amount of t-PA to the sample was measured by a sandwich
              solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-PAI-1
              and anti-t-PA monoclonal antibodies. The assay to measure total
              PAI-1 antigen used three monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies and had
              similar sensitivities to free active, latent, vitronectin-bound
              and t-PA-bound PAI-1. The specific activity of PAI-1 decreased in
              patients with DIC (43.7\% +/- 30.6\%) and in DIC cases with APL
              (10.3\% +/- 6.0\%) in comparison to patients with septicemia
              (83.7\% +/- 20.2\%) or normal controls (85.8\% +/- 27.3\%). In
              DIC associated with APL, degraded forms of PAI-1 were detected in
              plasma by immunoblotting. These results suggest that a decrease
              in the specific activity of PAI-1 and an increase in secondary
              fibrinolysis result in a hyperfibrinolytic state in DIC patients

              micrograms/mL inhibited plasma clot lysis and binding of t-PA to
              the clot. MA-1C8 had no influence on the activation of
              plasminogen by t-PA, which obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics with
              Km = 105 mumol/L and kcat = 0.05 s-1; however, it abolished the
              influence of CNBr-digested fibrinogen on Km. These findings

              complex and consists of disseminated intravascular coagulation
              (DIC) and hyperfibrinolysis. Elastase, derived from malignant
              promyelocytes, is believed to mediate the fibrinogeno- and
              fibrinolysis by aspecific proteolysis. In this study we measured
              the role of elastase in fifteen patients with APL by using an
              assay for elastase degraded fibrin(ogen) and the results were
              compared with those obtained in patients with sepsis induced DIC.
              High levels of elastase were observed in sepsis and APL. The
              levels of fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products were
              significantly higher in APL patients compared to patients with
              sepsis induced DIC. Nevertheless, the level of elastase degraded
              fibrin(ogen) was higher in the sepsis group (635.3 ng/ml,
              compared to 144.3 ng/ml in APL; p <0.0001). So, the enormous
              increase in fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products in APL
              cannot be explained by elastase activity. This study suggests a

  abstract = "Megakaryopoiesis involves the differentiation of progenitor cells
              into diploid megakaryocytes, which then undergo endomitosis and
              cytoplasmic maturation resulting in platelet release. Acute
              Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (AMKL) results when this process goes
              awry. Nearly one third of pediatric AMKL patients are infants who
              have the t (1;22) chromosomal translocation (t (1;22)-AMKL)
              resulting in fusion of the RNA Binding Motif 15 gene (RBM15) on
              chromosome 1 upstream of the transcriptional cofactor
              Megakaryoblastic Leukemia 1 gene (MKL1) on chromosome 22. Given
              that t (1;22)-AMKL primarily affects infants, the leukemia likely
              originates in utero when the hematopoietic system is in its
              embryonic stage.Our goal was to establish in vitro methods to
              study embryonic megakaryopoiesis and leukemogenesis using human
              and murine embryonic stem cells (hESCs and mESCs). Using the
              Invitrogen Gateway System, human MKL1 (hMKL1) and human
              RBM15-MKL1 (hRM) constructs were designed. H9-rtTA, a hESC line
              constitutively expressing the reverse transcriptional activator
              (rtTA) under the control of the Ubiquitin C promoter, were
              transduced with lentivirus harboring either hMKL1 or hRM with an
              IRES-GFP promoter under the control of the tetracycline
              responsive element (TRE) to derive doxycycline (dox) inducible
              cell lines. In the presence of dox, the rtTA binds to the TRE,
              causing transcriptional activation of the downstream transgene.
              hESC were co-cultured on murine OP-9 stromal cell layers with
              thrombopoietin to promote megakaryocytic differentiation. For
              construction of the inducible mESC lines, mESCs already
              containing the rtTA at the ROSA26 locus were electroporated with
              either murine MKL1 (mMKL1) or murine RBM15-MKL1 (mRM).
              Site-specific insertion of the transgenes using a cre recombinase
              and modified loxP sites placed mMKL1 or mRM under the control of
              a TRE. The inducible mMKL1 mESCs were differentiated into
              hematopoietic cells using embryoid body formation and
              subsequently co-cultured on OP-9s. The human and murine MKL1 and
              RM constructs were transiently transfected into 293FT cells and
              Western blotting was used to confirm their functionality. In the
              hESC studies, GFP expression was detected by flow cytometry 24
              hrs after dox induction in both cell lines, with 54.7\% (SD+3.1)
              GFP+ cells in hMKL1 transduced cells and 47.5\% (SD+16.2) GFP+
              cells in hRM transduced cells. hMKL1 protein was detected 24 hrs
              after dox induction; however, the hRM fusion protein was not
              detected in undifferentiated hESCs by Western blot or IP/IB after
              6, 24, 48, 72, 96 hrs of dox exposure. Nearly one fourth of the
              cells transduced with hRM were GFP+ after only 6 hrs of
              doxycycline exposure. Interestingly, with continued dox exposure
              over six days, GFP expression in the undifferentiated hESCs
              declined, with a mean decrease in GFP expression of 14.5\% in
              both cell lines. Successful incorporation of the vector carrying
              the hRM was confirmed by genomic PCR and resulted in
              dox-inducible expression of hRM mRNA detected by RT-PCR. Upon
              megakaryocytic differentiation, GFP and CD41 expression, detected
              by flow cytometry, occur in a mutually exclusive fashion in both
              MKL and RBM15-MKL1 transduced hESCs. In the mESC experiements,
              protein expression of mMKL1 in the undifferentiated cells was
              confirmed by Western blot 24, 48, and 72 hrs after dox addition.
              Expression of mRM protein in the undifferentiated mESCs was
              undetectable 6, 14, 24, 30, 48, or 72 hrs after dox addition.
              However, mRM mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR at 0, 6, 14, and 30
              hours after dox treatment in the undifferentiated mESCs. Of note,
              transient transfection of undifferentiated mESCs with mRM
              resulted in protein expression by Western blot as early as 6 hrs
              after transfection. The fusion protein continued to be detected
              at 12 and 18 hrs after transfection, but by 24 hrs, it was no
              longer detectable. When differentiated, the mMKL1 mESC line no
              longer demonstrated inducible mMKL1 expression in the CD41+
              (hematopoietic) population as determined by qRT-PCR. These
              findings confirm ongoing activity of the promoters in the
              undifferentiated hESC and mESC lines and indicate that the
              promoters may be silenced upon induction of hematopoietic
              differentiation of both hESC and mESC lines. In addition, the
              transient detection of RM after transfection into the mESCs
              suggests post-translational modification of the fusion protein
              likely results in its rapid degradation.",

  abstract = "Thrombopoietin (TPO) is recognized as the main regulator of
              platelet production, yet its genetic ablation in mice does not
              completely obliterate thrombopoiesis, suggesting that alternate
              pathways could lead to platelet formation. We recently identified
              a naturally-occurring protein that acts as a potent agonist of
              platelet production by a mechanism distinct from that of TPO.
              This protein belongs to a novel class of human extracellular
              signaling proteins called physiocrines that are generated from
              tRNA synthetases by alternative splicing or proteolysis.
              Physiocrines interact with several classes of receptors through
              unique mechanisms to modulate cellular differentiation and tissue
              homeostasis in normal and pathological processes. The newly
              identified thrombopoietic physiocrine, termed ATYR0030, is an
              engineered version of a naturally-occurring physiocrine derived
              from the tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (YRS). In vivo, systemic
              administration of ATYR0030 or YRS physiocrine to rats led to an
              increase in platelets counts comparable to that seen with TPO
              treatment, but with a greater effect in animals with low baseline
              platelet levels. When injected into normal animals preselected
              for low platelet counts, ATYR0030 treatment resulted in an
              increase in platelets up to, but not beyond, normal levels
              (Figure 1), suggesting a role in platelet homeostasis and
              differentiating its effects from the known activity of TPO.
              Intravenous administration of ATYR0030 also accelerated recovery
              of platelet counts in carboplatin-treated rats, indicating a
              possible role in bone marrow reconstitution after chemical
              insult. Consistent with homeostatic properties, no toxicity was
              seen in a repeat-dose 28-day non-GLP safety study in rats dosed
              up to 100-fold above the efficacious range. Histopathology
              assessment revealed no tissue abnormalities, no increase in bone
              marrow reticulin and no hyperplasia of myeloid precursors.
              Clinical chemistry and hematology parameters were in the normal
              range with a modest increase in platelet counts, as anticipated
              in animals with normal platelet levels. [Image Presented] Our in
              vitro data suggest that ATYR0030 may play a role in
              megakaryopoiesis by facilitating cell migration and adhesion to
              the vasculature. In contrast to TPO, ATYR0030 does not directly
              signal through the TPO receptor and does not activate the
              JAK/STAT pathway but rather appears to engage specific G-protein
              coupled receptors. In vitro, ATYR0030 does not stimulate
              proliferation of cultured M07e human megakaryoblasts or primary
              bone marrow cells isolated from AML patients (Figure 2). The
              parent synthetase is present in human platelets and is secreted
              in response to platelet activation, perhaps providing a feedback
              mechanism to stimulate the release of new platelets. In an effort
              to link the biological activity of ATYR0030 and the role that the
              parent synthetase plays in human physiology, we have begun to
              analyze samples from patients with abnormal platelets counts to
              determine circulating levels of the parent synthetase. [Image
              Presented] The unique thrombopoietic activity of ATYR0030 may
              lead to an orthogonal approach to restoring normal platelet
              levels in thrombocytopenic patients who currently have limited
              treatment options. For example, in the myelodysplastic syndrome
              population, TPO-receptor agonists carry a risk of stimulating
              blast proliferation and accelerating disease progression to acute
              myeloid leukemia (AML). The distinct proliferation profile of
              ATYR0030 may translate into important safety benefits by reducing
              the risk of progression to AML. In addition, the potential role
              of ATYR0030 in regulating platelet homeostasis may provide a
              greater safety margin in the normalization of platelet levels,
              thereby also limiting the risk of thrombosis. Leveraging the
              therapeutic potential of this thrombopoietic physiocrine may lead
              to the development of a novel treatment option with a favorable
              safety profile.",

              allocation for clinical trials. We conducted a systematic
              literature search to determine its advantages and disadvantages
              compared with other allocation methods. Minimization was
              originally proposed by Taves and by Pocock and Simon. The latter
              paper introduces a family of allocation methods of which Taves'
              method is the simplest example. Minimization aims to ensure
              treatment arms are balanced with respect to predefined patient
              factors as well as for the number of patients in each group.
              Further extensions of the method have also been proposed by other
              authors. Simulation studies show that minimization provides
              better balanced treatment groups when compared with restricted or
              unrestricted randomization and that it can incorporate more
              prognostic factors than stratified randomization methods such as
              permuted blocks within strata. Some more computationally complex
              methods may give an even better performance. Concerns over the
              use of minimization have centered on the fact that treatment
              assignments may be predicted with certainty in some situations
              and on the implications for the analysis methods used. It has
              been suggested that adjustment should always be made for
              minimization factors when analyzing trials where minimization is
              the allocation method used. The use of minimization may sometimes
              result in added organizational complexity compared with other
              methods. Minimization has been recommended by many commentators
              for use in clinical trials. Despite this it is still rarely used
              in practice. From the evidence presented in this review, we
              believe minimization to be a highly effective allocation method
              and recommend its wider adoption in the conduct of randomized
              controlled trials.",

              selected patients with end-stage post-necrotic and cholestatic
              liver diseases. These individuals typically have disturbed
              haemostasis, which reflects both impaired hepatic synthesis of
              clotting factors and disseminated intravascular coagulation
              compounded by large-volume transfusions of blood products
              occasionally required during surgery. The latter contribute
              significantly to the cost of this procedure, but may approximate
              the cumulative consumption of that required for the support of
              patients in liver failure. Perspective is provided by prospective
              analysis of data from the first 10 patients in the current
              programme. There were striking, if transient, intra-operative
              changes in standard laboratory parameters of coagulation and
              fibrinolysis; all patients were readily controlled with
              replacement therapy administered according to serial haemostatic
              measurements combined with clinical judgement. In most patients
              these values had stabilised within 24 hours of surgery. Those
              with post-necrotic liver cirrhosis had the most marked degrees of
              hepatic dysfunction, reflected in more profound haemostatic
              disturbances; these patients required the largest amounts of
              blood products. Inclusive median costs for the first year were
              estimated at R35,000 and for the first 5 years at R60,000, with
              80\% of the patients expected to be alive between 5 and 10 years
              later and enjoying an excellent quality of life. These figures
              contrast with those estimated for optimal medical and
              non-transplant surgical management following variceal bleeding as
              a major complication of liver disease (R30,000 for the first year
              and R70,000 at 3 years). In addition, the latter patients would
              usually be unable to work and have a poor quality of life with
              minimal likelihood of survival beyond this point. We conclude
              that with a multidisciplinary approach in an academic centre,
              surgical replacement of the irreversibly damaged liver in

              was designed to evaluate prospectively fibrinolytic parameters in
              leukemic children receiving different E. coli ASP preparations
              (Kyowa ASP, n = 20; Bayer ASP, n = 20), and to relate changes in

              METHODS: Blood samples for coagulation studies were obtained
              together with serum samples for pharmacokinetic monitoring in the
              same venipuncture (before the first and 6th-7th doses of ASP).
              RESULTS: Patients receiving Kyowa ASP showed significantly
              (0.0001) enhanced ASP-activity compared to children treated with
              the Bayer preparation. Significantly decreased values of

              pneumonia in patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and T-cell
              acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RhAPC, limited the
              coagulation cascade by inactivating FVa and FVIIIa, directly and
              indirectly limiting systemic inflammatory response syndrome
              (SIRS), and improved the fibrinolysis process. These actions
              break the pathomechanism of sepsis and improve survival. CASE
              REPORT: Besides intensive, multidirectional treatment of severe
              sepsis, Xigris (activated drotrecogin alfa) was administered on
              the second day in both cases. The infusion continued, as
              recommended, for 96 hours without complications. During treatment
              the patients' general condition and respiratory efficiency
              improved, allowing respirator weaning on days 5 and 8 of therapy.
              These cases of severe sepsis and immunosuppression indicate a
              high therapeutic efficacy of drotrecogin alfa (activated).
              Treatment outcome was uncertain because of the patients'
              hematological condition, so rapid restoration of respiratory
              efficiency and no disease progression after discontinuing
              treatment was a great success, possibly due to implementing
              Xigris at a relatively early stage of sepsis and the intensive
              therapy conducted according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign
              guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Patient survival in severe sepsis
              directly depends on early diagnosis and institution of treatment.

              leukaemia line HL-60. This paper reports that monocyte
              differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin
              D2 (vitamin D2) results in a marked increase in expression of
              u-PA and u-PA-R. This increase in u-PA expression is of greater
              magnitude than is observed after culture with interferon-gamma
              (IFN gamma), another potent inducer of monocytic differentiation.
              Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), an agent that induces granulocytic
              differentiation, also increased expression of u-PA. However,
              culture with the granulocyte-inducing all-trans retinoic acid
              (RA) did not induce an increase in surface expression of u-PA or
              u-PA-R. The vitamin D2-induced increase in cell-surface u-PA was
              not coincident with an increase in steady-state levels of u-PA

              translational or post-translational mechanisms of regulation, or
              some other regulatory mechanism may be responsible for the

              for bleeding [one (0, 2) v zero (0, 0); P = .0003]. In contrast,
              patients on the < or = 20,000/microL arm received more platelet
              transfusions for prophylactic indications [10 (5, 14) v six (3,
              8); P = 0.001], as would be expected, but less for bleeding.
              Nevertheless, the total number of platelet transfusions given to
              patients on the < or = 20,000/microL arm was higher and nearly
              significant [11 (6, 15) v seven (5, 11); P = .07]. There were no
              statistically significant differences between the groups with
              regard to RBC transfusion requirements, febrile days, days
              hospitalized, days thrombocytopenic, need for HLA-matched
              platelets, remission rate, or death during induction
              chemotherapy. No patient in either group died from hemorrhage or
              underwent major surgery for bleeding complications. CONCLUSION:
              Giving prophylactic platelets at a threshold of < or =
              10,000/microL compared with < or = 20,000/microL can decrease the
              total utilization of platelets with only a small adverse effect
              on bleeding, and no statistically significant effect on
              morbidity.",

  abstract = "Introduction: Panobinostat (LBH589), a hydroxamic acid
              derivative, is a potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) with
              anti-tumor activity in a wide variety of preclinical cancer
              models and promising clinical activity in Phase I/II trials. In
              preclinical toxicity studies, the hematopoietic and lymphatic
              systems were identified as primary target organs; panobinostat
              has demonstrated reversible myelosuppression, including decreased
              platelet release, which may be due to a delay in maturation of
              megakaryocytes. Hematology parameters are closely monitored in
              clinical trials, especially when panobinostat is combined with
              concomitant medications associated with myelosuppression.
              Thrombocytopenia is the most common adverse event (AE) associated
              with panobinostat treatment in the clinic. This analysis
              represents the first clinical characterization of
              thrombocytopenia in patients treated with oral, single-agent
              panobinostat in Phase I and II studies. Patients and methods:
              Analysis was performed on pooled data from eight completed or
              ongoing Phase I and II studies in patients with advanced
              hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. The following doses and
              28-day cycle dosing schedules were analyzed: doses ranging from
              20 to 60 mg/dose (administered on Days 1, 3 and 5 [TIW every
              week]) or 30 to 60 mg/dose (TIW every other week). Patients with
              a baseline and at least one post-baseline platelet count value
              were included in the dataset. Patients were counted only once
              based on the worst post-baseline value. Results: The pooled
              analysis included data from 308 patients (120 female/188 male)
              with a median age of 59 years (range: 16-87), with solid
              tumors/lymphomas/myeloma (receiving panobinostat weekly [n=84] or
              every other week [n=19]) or with other hematologic malignancies,
              especially with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic
              syndrome (receiving panobinostat weekly [n=175] or every other
              week [n=30]). Newly occurring or worsening thrombocytopenia was
              the most common lab abnormality of any grade and of Grade 3/4
              (88\% any grade, 64\% Grade 3/4) with weekly dosing. Frequency of
              Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia correlated with increasing weekly
              doses, occurring in 38\% of patients at 20 mg, 63\% at 30 mg,
              85\% at 40 mg and 95\% at 60 mg/dose. With every-other-week
              dosing, Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 67\% of
              patients across doses (67\% of patients at 30 mg, 63\% at 45 mg
              and 70\% at 60 mg/dose). Median time to thrombocytopenia, for
              patients with solid tumors/lymphomas/myeloma or with other
              hematologic malignancies, respectively, was 15 and 30 days on the
              weekly schedule (n=84 and 175 pts), and 64 and 8 days on the
              every-other-week schedule (n=19 and 30 pts). Thrombocytopenia was
              the most common reason for dose adjustments or discontinuation.
              Incidence of at least one dose reduction due to AE or lab
              abnormality for patients with either solid
              tumors/lymphomas/myeloma or with other hematologic malignancies,
              respectively, was 45\% and 29\% on the weekly schedule vs 37\%
              and 10\% on the every-other-week schedule. Consequently, median
              exposure to panobinostat was variable for patients with solid
              tumors and hematologic malignancies, respectively, on the weekly
              schedule (56.5 days and 33 days) vs every other week (117 days
              and 45 days), suggesting a trend favoring the every-other-week
              schedule. Separate time-to-event analysis revealed other
              hematologic malignancy, lower platelet count at baseline and
              lower body surface area as potential risk factors for
              thrombocytopenia. The event was generally effectively managed by
              dose interruption or dose reduction and platelet transfusion
              predominantly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or
              myelodysplastic syndrome. Conclusions: Thrombocytopenia is
              commonly observed with panobinostat but is generally predictable,
              manageable and reversible. Every-other-week (TIW) dosing
              schedules of oral panobinostat may effectively reduce the
              incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia and the number of dose
              reductions or interruptions or need for transfusions. Results of
              this pooled analysis suggest that every-other-week dosing
              schedules of oral panobinostat may be better tolerated with
              regard to thrombocytopenia. This finding warrants further
              investigation in ongoing, planned Phase II and III studies.",

  abstract = "Introduction: Current therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is
              inadequate. Treatment of older patients considered unfit for
              standard induction therapy is particularly challenging (Juliusson
              et al. Blood 2009). Hypomethylating agents (HMA) are commonly
              used alternatives for these patients (Fenaux et al. JCO 2010). In
              the case of azacitidine, complete and partial response rates
              range between 15-30\% (Maurillo et al. Cancer 2012) and the
              addition of other drugs (e.g. lenalidomide and vorinostat) has
              been limited by toxicity. In this study, we sought to improve the
              activity of azacitidine by adding the non-steroidal
              anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), sodium salicylate (NSal). NSAIDs
              exert anti-cancer effects through impaired signal transduction
              (inhibition of NF-kB and Wnt/B catenin pathways) (Kop et al.
              Science 1994; Reya et al. Nature 2003), epigenetic modulation and
              disruption of cellular metabolism (activation of AMPK) (Wang et
              al. CMLS 2013). In addition, previous reports have demonstrated
              that NSal combines synergistically with established anti-leukemic
              agents (daunorubicin) (Klampfer et al. Blood 1999), through
              down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Importantly,
              NSal has no effect on platelet function and a small pilot trial
              (N=11) confirmed the clinical feasibility of this agent in
              patients with refractory myeloid neoplasms (Klimek et al.
              Leukemia Research 2012). In this study, therapeutic plasma
              concentrations of NSal were safely achieved without excessive
              NSAID class effects (GI and renal toxicity, bleeding). Here, we
              report the in vitro effects of NSal combined with azacitidine and
              suggest a rationale for exploring this combination further in the
              clinic. Methods: AML cell lines (HL-60, KG-1a and THP-1) were
              treated with increasing concentrations of NSal (0.2-20mM),
              azacitidine (0.02-10$\mu$M) and both agents combined. Consequent
              effects on cell viability were measured by trypan blue exclusion
              and cell proliferation assay (MTT based). Apoptosis was measured
              by FACS analysis for propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V binding.
              Synergistic lethality was calculated using the Chou-Talalay
              method (Calcusyn software). Critical mediators underlying
              mechanism were measured by immunoblotting (Mcl-1). Results: The
              degree of apoptosis in AML cells treated with sub-lethal
              concentrations of NSal (0.2-20mM) and azacitidine (0.02-10$\mu$M)
              was compared to the degree of apoptosis induced by the
              combination. Little effect on the viability of HL-60, KG-1a and
              THP-1 cell lines was observed after 48 hours exposure to either
              agent alone, however, in the presence of 2 $\mu$M azacitidine and
              2mM NSal, 39.2\% of THP-1 cells were dead at 48 hours (annexin V
              binding). The combination of 0.2 $\mu$M azacitidine and 2mM NSal
              had significantly inhibited cell proliferation at 72 hours. Cell
              proliferation decreased by 47.4\%, 25\%, and 66.1\% in HL-60,
              KG-1a, and THP-1, cell lines, respectively. Combination index
              (CI) values (Calcusyn software) were less than 1 indicating
              synergistic activity. The expression of Mcl-1 decreased in a
              dose- and time-dependent manner in salicylate treated cells which
              might account for its ability to enhance cell killing by
              azacitidine. Conclusions: Sodium salicylate has a priming effect
              when combined with azacitidine in pre-clinical models of AML.
              Despite the high pre-clinical concentrations of NSal evaluated,
              previous studies have confirmed the feasibility of achieving
              therapeutically active plasma concentrations in patients (Klimek
              et al. Leukemia Research 2012). This study forms a rationale for
              a clinical investigation of this approach. Additional in vitro
              mechanistic studies elucidating the combined effects of NSal and
              azacitidine will be presented.",

              and mutation analysis. Results. Although karyotyping and mutation
              analysis of both the index patient and his mother showed normal
              results, interphase FISH revealed 3 signals for the RUNX1 locus.
              Array CGH demonstrated 3 minor aberrations (2 gains and 1 loss)
              of distinct regions of chromosome 21q22, but could not explain
              the extra FISH signal. Therefore, it was speculated that an
              intra-chromosomal rearrangement with a breakpoint through RUNX1
              had resulted in a split signal. This was confirmed by capture
              array data, which demonstrated a fusion of the 5' RUNX1
              breakpoint to a chromosome 21 sequence 11 Mb upstream (same
              orientation). Summary and Conclusions. Based on the results so
              far, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement with several
              breakpoints on chromosome 21 resulted in the disruption of the
              RUNX1 gene. Currently, further investigations by using a novel
              next-generation sequencing technique are ongoing. We will perform
              genomewide long mate-pair sequencing in order to delineate an
              exact map of the affected chromosome 21 in this family. By using
              this map, a diagnostic test for carriership analysis will be made
              available for screening family members at risk of developing
              MDS/AML themselves or as potential transplantation donors.
              Affected family members, especially the patient diagnosed with
              ALL, will also be examined. It is important to realize that
              adequate screening of families for predisposition to MDS/AML not
              only involves mutation analysis, but that other methods (e.g.
              aCGH, FISH) and genetic counseling should also be considered.",

              the incidence of thrombosis may be as high (or even higher) in
              patients with malignant haematological disorders. However, this
              may be obscured by the significant morbidity and mortality due to
              other complications of haematological malignancies, such as
              bleeding and infections. The vast majority of patients with
              haematological neoplasias also have clinically silent haemostatic
              abnormalities, but some may show clinical manifestations,
              including venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism,
              disseminated intravascular coagulation and life-threatening
              thrombohaemorrhagic syndrome in acute leukaemias. The
              pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease in haematological
              malignancies is complex and multifactorial: tumour cell-derived
              procoagulant, fibrinolytic or proteolytic factors and
              inflammatory cytokines affect clotting activation, and
              chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs increase thrombotic risk
              in patients with lymphoma, acute leukaemia and multiple myeloma.
              Infectious complications are another important factor: endotoxins
              from gram-negative bacteria induce the release of tissue factor
              (TF), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and
              gram-positive organisms can release bacterial mucopolysaccharides
              that directly activate factor XII. Leukaemic patients may be
              affected by other prothrombotic factors, including
              hyperleukocytosis, increased TF expression and activation, and
              the prothrombotic properties of therapeutic agents such as
              all-trans retinoic acid and L-asparaginase, which can induce
              thrombosis involving multiple organs. The very high risk of
              haemorrhaging in these patients warrants prospective randomised

              study, the first comprehensive evaluation of the various aspects
              of the hemostatic system in a population of patients with acute
              myeloid leukemia was performed. Eighteen patients (23-71 years of
              age) were studied at either diagnosis or relapse. Hemostatic
              studies were performed at onset and on days 3, 7, and 30 after
              initiation of therapy. The bone marrow blast counts ranged from
              8\% to 98\%; prothrombin time and activated partial
              thromboplastin time showed only minor prolongations in a few of
              these patients. However, in all patients measurement of
              platelet-associated markers revealed elevated platelet factor 4
              and thromboxane B2 and normal 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha
              levels. Fibrinolytic markers showed an increase in D-dimer and
              tissue plasminogen activator and a decrease in alpha
              2-antiplasmin levels. Plasminogen, plasminogen activator
              inhibitor, and fibrinogen levels were normal. Coagulation markers
              demonstrated a decrease in protein C and antithrombin III levels
              and an elevation of the thrombin-antithrombin complex. The
              pretreatment values for all hemostatic markers studied were
              similar to the values obtained on days 3, 7, and 30 during

              activation of the components of the hemostatic system possibly
              leading to a hypercoagulable state. Although only six patients
              (33\%) experienced hemorrhagic complications, the risk of
              bleeding and/or thrombosis was strongly evident in all patients.

              the practicability of a more restrictive transfusion policy has
              been assessed prospectively in 102 consecutive patients being
              treated for acute leukaemia. Besides platelet count, the

              presence of bleeding, fever, coagulation disorders, and intention
              to do therapeutic procedures. 31 major bleeding episodes occurred
              on 1.9\% of the study days when platelet counts were 10 x 10(9)/l

              acquired disease with transient or persistent decrease of

              in the immune regulation and are known to be deregulated in
              autoimmune diseases. This study aimed to investigate serum IL-16
              levels in relation to reticulated platelets in children with ITP
              and platelet count. Twenty six children with ITP (11 with newly
              diagnosed ITP, 9 with persistent ITP and 6 with chronic ITP) and
              12 age-matched healthy children controls were studied. Serum
              level of IL-16 and reticulated platelets count were assessed by
              Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry
              respectively. Serum IL-16 levels were significantly higher in
              patients as compared to controls (P < 0.001). Within patients,
              the levels were higher in newly diagnosed compared to persistent
              and chronic ITP (P < 0.01) and (P < 0.001) respectively. IL-16
              levels were also significantly higher in persistent ITP compared
              to chronic ITP (P < 0.001). Reticulated platelets were also
              elevated in patients compared to controls and the increase was
              significant in newly diagnosed group (P < 0.05). Negative
              correlation was found between IL-16 level and reticulated

              valuable in predicting the clinical course of pediatrics ITP.
              Measurement of reticulated platelets may provide significant

              therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The prospective study conducted at
              the Department for High-Dose Chemotherapy and Bone Marrow
              Transplantation, Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health
              of the Russian Federation, in March 2012 to May 2013, enrolled 25
              patients (13 men and 12 women) aged 29-72 years (median age 54
              years) with new-onset MM. The latter was staged using the
              Durie-Salmon classification: Stages I, II, and III were
              determined in 2, 10, and 13 patients, respectively. Seven
              patients were found to have renal dysfunction (which corresponded
              to Substage B). The hemostasis was evaluated from the results of
              the following tests: activated partial thromboplastin time
              (APTT), thrombin time (TT), Xlla-dependent fibrinolysis time,
              Quick prothrombin index, international normalized ratio (INR),
              and fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations. The investigators used
              new hemostatic techniques, such as thrombin generation test,
              thromboelastography, as well as thrombodynamics, a novel method
              to determine the characteristics of spatial clot growth.
              Induction therapy was performed using the PAD and VCD regimens.
              Thromboses were prevented by using 24-hour infusion of
              unfractionated heparin (500 U/hr) or by administering aspirin
              (100 mg/day). RESULTS: Hypercoagulability was identified in 17
              (68\%) patients. Eleven (44\%) patients had elevated D-dimer
              concentrations. The level of D-dimer was statistically
              significantly positively correlated with the endogenous thrombin
              potential and the amount of beta2-microglobulin. The
              thrombodynamic technique revealed an inverse relationship between
              the level of paraprotein and the optimal density of a fibrin
              clot. A thrombotic episode was seen in one elderly (71-year-old)
              patient after aspirin discontinuation during long-term
              immobilization. CONCLUSION: Nearly 50\% of the primary patients
              with MM were ascertained to be more prone to thrombosis. Infusion
              of unfractionated heparin in a dose of 500 U/hr or administration
              of aspirin (100 mg/day) was the adequate prevention of thrombotic
              events.",

              further increase of thrombotic complications. Objective. To
              investigate fibrin clot properties in MM patients prior and after
              induction remission with thalidomide. Patients and Methods. We
              studied 38 consecutive MM patients, 19 men and 19 women, aged 49
              to 81 years (mean 63.5 years), with no history of VTE. There were
              18 cases of IgG MM, 10 of IgA MM and 10 with light chain disease
              (LCD). Staging according to Durie and Salmon disclosed 5 subjects
              with IIA stage, 2 with IIB, 17 with IIIA, and 14 with IIIB.
              Fifteen patients completed treatment according to CTD, 2-6
              cycles, mean 3.7 (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/d i.v., day 1,
              thalidomide 100 mg/d, dexamethasone 10 mg/d on days 1-4 and
              9-12). All MM patients received aspirin 75 mg/d. The control
              group comprised of 38 healthy subjects matched for age and
              gender. Plasma fibrin clot permeability, turbidity and
              fibrinolysis were assessed at baseline and after treatment with
              thalidomide. Results. Fibrinogen plasma concentration was higher
              in MM patients compared with controls (4.03 $\pm$ 1.48 vs 2.62
              $\pm$ 0.43 g/L, P<.0001). The highest fibrinogen was found in LCD
              subgroup. Fibrin clots in MM patients compared with those
              obtained from controls had lower clot permeability (5.19 $\pm$
              1.28 v 8.89 $\pm$ 0.77 10-9cm2, respectively, P< .0001),
              prolonged clot lysis time (12.5 $\pm$ 2.2 v 8.06 $\pm$ 0.94 min,
              P<.00001), and lower baseline maximum clot absorbancy at 405 nm
              (0.56 $\pm$ 0.1 v 0.79 $\pm$ 0.06, respectively, P<.0001).
              Baseline maximum velocity of D-dimer release from plasma clots
              subjected to tissue plasminogen activator was lower in the MM
              group than in controls (0.066 $\pm$ 0.006 v 0.077 $\pm$ 0.006
              mg/L/min, P<.00001), while the initial maximum D-dimer level was
              higher in MM patients (4.76 $\pm$ 0.62 v 3.48 $\pm$0.27, mg/L,
              P<.00001). MM patients with renal insufficiency (n= 16) had
              significantly lower clot permeability than the remainder
              (n=22;P<.0013). Comparison of fibrin clot obtained from patients
              after treatment with thalidomide with that prior the treatment
              did not show changes in fibrinogen concentrations (3.9 $\pm$1.2 v
              4.03 $\pm$1.48 g/L, P<.2), in clot permeability (5.49 $\pm$1.3 v
              5.19 $\pm$ 1.28 10-9 cm2, P <.4),or in clot lysis time (12,3
              $\pm$ 1,78 v 12,5 $\pm$ 2,2 min, P<.7) but maximum clot
              absorbancy (0.72 $\pm$ 0.1 v 0.56 $\pm$ 0.1, P <.003) and the
              rate of Ddimer release from clots (0.073 $\pm$ 0.008 v 0.066
              $\pm$ 0.006 mg/L/min, P<.0069) was higher. Out of 38 MM patients
              treated with thalidomide 6 subjects developed venous or arterial
              thrombosis and they had lower clot permeability compared to the
              remaining individuals (P<.05); other fibrin clot variables were
              similar in both subgroups. Conclusion. Substantial prothrombotic
              alterations of fibrin clot properties, including markedly
              impaired fibrinolysis occur in patients with MM and

              receptor (uPAR, CD87) mediate complementary functions in
              myelomonocytic cells. Both receptors promote degradation of
              fibrin(ogen) and also confer adhesive properties on cells because
              Mac-1 and uPAR bind fibrin and vitronectin, respectively.
              Staining of lung biopsy specimens from patients with acute lung
              injury indicated that fibrin and vitronectin colocalize at
              exudative sites in which macrophages bearing these receptors
              accumulate. Because of the parallel roles and physical proximity
              of Mac-1 and uPAR, the capacity of these receptors to
              functionally interact was explored. Induction of Mac-1 and uPAR
              expression on monocytic cell lines by transforming growth factor-
              beta 1 and 1.25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 conferred urokinase and
              uPAR-dependent adhesion to vitronectin, which was further
              promoted by engagement of Mac-1. Vitronectin attachment promoted
              subsequent Mac-1-mediated fibrinogen degradation threefold to
              fourfold. In contrast, enhancement of uPAR occupancy by exogenous
              urokinase or receptor binding fragments thereof inhibited Mac-1
              function. Addition of urokinase progressively inhibited
              Mac-1-mediated fibrinogen binding and degradation (maximal
              inhibition, 91\% +/- 14\% and 72\% +/- 15\%, respectively).
              Saturation of uPAR with urokinase also inhibited binding of the
              procoagulant Mac-1 ligand, Factor X. These inhibitory effects of
              uPAR were reproduced in fresh monocytes, cultured monocytic
              cells, and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with
              both human Mac-1 and human uPAR. These data show that the
              procoagulant and fibrinolytic potential of monocytic cells is
              co-ordinately regulated by ligand binding to both Mac-1 and uPAR
              and identify uPAR as a regulator of integrin function.
              Vitronectin-enhanced fibrin(ogen) turnover by Mac-1 may operate
              as a salvage pathway in the setting of urokinase and plasmin
              inhibitors to promote clearance of the provisional matrix and

              leukemia (FPD/AML) is a rare autosomal dominant disease
              characterized by thrombocytopenia, abnormality of platelet
              function, and a propensity to develop myelodysplastic syndrome
              (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The disorder was
              shown to be caused by germline mutations in the RUNX1, which is a
              key regulator of definitive hematopoiesis and of myeloid
              differentiation. Here, we report a new Japanese pedigree with
              FPD/AML harboring RUNX1 mutation. The proband was diagnosed with
              refractory cytopenia at the age of 10 after 8-year follow-up with
              mild to moderate thrombocytopenia. Cytogenetic analysis revealed
              normal karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization showed
              neither monosomy 7 nor trisomy 8. Her elder sister also was
              followed for 10 years with mild thrombocytopenia, but the
              morphological findings of peripheral blood or the bone marrow
              were not dysplastic. While her father died of MDS at the age of
              43, her paternal aunt developed MDS at the age of 49 and remains
              in complete remission for 10 years after successful allogeneic
              cord blood transplantation. Her paternal grandfather and uncle
              also had a history of thrombocytopenia. Direct sequencing
              analysis of RUNX1 in the proband and her sister revealed a
              one-base deletion in exon 7 resulting in a frameshift mutation
              and an early truncated protein. This mutation was not detected in
              their mother. Inherited RUNX1 mutations clustered to the
              N-terminal region in exons 3 to 5, which affect runt homology
              domain. Mutations in the C-terminal region, detected in the
              presented pedigree, have been reported less frequently so far,
              and are thought to affect transactivation domain. Although
              FPD/AML is thought to be rare, the screening for RUNX1 mutation
              may be indicated in children suspected of having familial

              increased risk of thrombosis. Hypofibrinolysis is among the
              various identified abnormalities in the hemostasis system that
              may cause a prothrombotic state. The aim of the study was
              intended to evaluate the association between certain rotational
              thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters with tissue plasminogen
              activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
              levels and myeloma proteins in patients with MM and in controls.
              MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 21 patients with MM at
              the time of diagnosis and 15 healthy volunteers. Maximum clot
              lysis (ML), clot lysis index at 30, 45 and 60 minutes (LI 30, LI
              45, LI 60 respectively), t-PA and PAI-1 activity were among the
              parameters studied. RESULTS: According to the FIB TEM test, ML
              readings were markedly lower (1\% v. 3\%, p = 0.04) while LI 45,
              LI60 parameters were significantly higher (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04)
              in MM group than in controls. Also median, MCF readings (22 mm v.
              16 mm, p = 0.01) and alpha-angle values (80 degrees v 74, p =
              0.002) were significantly higher in MM according to the FIBTEM
              assay. Statistically significant higher median values of PAL-1
              levels were observed in the MM group than in controls. In MM
              patients correlations between PAI-1 a LI 45-FIBTEM (r = - 0.65)
              and between t-PA a LI60- EXTEM (r = 0.45) were discovered. In MM
              IgG group correlation between IgG protein concentration and
              MCF-FIBTEM (r = 0.62) was shown. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in ROTEM
              parameters and PAI-1 levels which may indicate a hypofibrinolytic
              state were found to occur in patients with MM at the time of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: GM-CSF has broad clinical applicability as a potent
              myelopoietic stimulator. However, its function is not restricted
              to the myelopoietic system and several observations suggest that
              GM-CSF may interfere with the hemostatic balance. In order to
              assess whether GM-CSF has any influence on hemostasis, we
              evaluated some coagulative and fibrinolytic parameters in
              patients treated with GM-CSF following chemotherapy. METHODS:
              Fibrinolytic activity (FA), fibrinogen and D-dimer were evaluated
              before and after high-dose cyclophosphamide in 6 patients
              additionally treated with GM-CSF and in 5 control patients;
              moreover, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was assayed in those
              treated with GM-CSF. Comparative in vitro analysis was performed
              on cultured endothelial cells before and after exposure to
              GM-CSF. RESULTS: Control patients showed a significant decrease
              in plasma FA after chemotherapy compared to basal values (FA/mm2:
              15.6 +/- 2.1 at day + 2 and 20.8 +/- 19 at day + 4 vs. 103.8 +/-
              64.2 at day 0; p < 0.005); conversely, no FA reduction was
              observed in GM-CSF-treated subjects. In this latter group a
              marked increase in tPA antigen was seen, consistent with enhanced
              FA. No significant changes in plasma D-dimer and fibrinogen
              values were detected in the two groups. tPA, urokinase-type
              plasminogen activator, PAI-1 and procoagulant activity were
              evaluated in vitro on cultured human endothelial cells and found
              to be unchanged following GM-CSF addition. CONCLUSIONS: The
              results demonstrate that high-dose chemotherapy may negatively
              influence plasma FA. This adverse side effect is neutralized by
              GM-CSF administration. The discrepancy found between in vitro and
              in vivo GM-CSF activity on hemostatic may be explained by in vivo
              GM-CSF stimulation of cell types other than endothelial cells.",

              coagulopathy combining disseminated intravascular coagulation
              (DIC) and fibrinolysis. Anthracy cline-cytosine arabinoside (Ara
              C) intensive chemotherapy yields a complete remission in 50
              percent (\%) to 80\% of newly diagnosed APL patients. Failure to
              achieve complete remission results in fatal bleeding due to
              coagulopathy or fatal sepsis during the phase of aplasia. It has
              been recently shown that all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
              selectively differentiates abnormal promyelocytes into mature
              granulocytes in APL, both in vitro and in vivo, and induced
              complete remission in 80\% to 90\% of the newly diagnosed
              patients. It has also been observed that therapy with ATRA
              rapidly improved coagulopathy, and induced no aplasia. However,
              in 30\% of patients the treatment with ATRA as a single drug was
              associated with rapid increase in leukocytes and signs of ``ATRA
              syndrome'', which could have fatal outcome. Therefore the
              European study group initiated in 1991 a multicentre randomised
              trial comparing chemotherapy with daunorubicin Ara C
              (chemotherapy group) and ATRA combined to the same chemotherapy
              (ATRA group) in newly diagnosed APL patients, aged 65 years or
              less. Results of this study strongly suggest that ATRA should be
              incorporated in the front line therapy of newly diagnosed APL.
              The aim of our study was to confirm their results in our newly
              diagnosed patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study we had 15
              subsequently hospitalised patients with APL in whom diagnosis was
              made according to MIC classification, and who were treated with
              ATRA (Vesanoid-Hoffman La Roche) combined with chemotherapy
              according to the recommendation of the European study groups. The
              comparison of the effect of ATRA we has evaluated by the outcome
              of APL in 12 patients who received only combined chemotherapy in
              induction phase according to the Yu-AML-89 protocol 12 or
              01-AM-86 protocol. Both protocols include daunorubicin and Ara C.
              In all patients MIC classification was performed. Characteristics
              of the patients included in the study with special emphasis to
              symptoms at presentation, are given in Table 1. TREATMENT:
              Patients treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy received daily oral
              dose of ATRA 45 mg/m2 until the complete remission, or for a
              maximum of 90 days. After complete remission they received three
              courses of daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 for 3 days, and Ara C 200 mg/m2
              for 7 days. However, course one was added to ATRA on day one of
              treatment of initial leukocyte counts were greater than 5 x
              10(9)/L or rapidly started to increase to above 6 x 10(9)/L or
              more. Patients treated with chemotherapy received only in
              induction phase daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 for 4 days and Ara C 200
              mg/m for 7 days as well as the intensive platelet support,
              heparin, fresh frozen plasma in those with bleeding. During the
              study haemostasis monitoring was performed in all patients.
              Complete remission was defined according to the criteria of the
              European study group. Early death was defined as a death during
              the therapy with ATRA or chemotherapy due to ``ATRA syndrome'',
              bleeding, aplasia, or resistant leukaemia. Statistical analysis
              was performed according to the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS:
              Relevant haematological and pathobiological characteristics at
              presentation are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that there were
              no significant characteristic differences at presentation between
              ATRA group and chemotherapy group. The effects of the treatment
              are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that complete remission was
              achieved in 87\% of patients receiving ATRA combined with
              chemotherapy and only in 42\% of patients who received combined
              chemotherapy. This difference is significant (p < 0.01). Duration
              of complete remission lasted for 14 months (median) in the
              patients receiving ATRA while only 5 months (median) in the
              patients who received combined chemotherapy. Fatal outcome in
              ATRA group occurred in 13\% due to the ``ATRA syndrome'' and in
              58\% of the patients treated with combined chemotherapy due to
              bleeding. Table 4 shows four selected patients from ATRA group in
              whom complete remission was followed with disappearance of t
              (15;17), thus providint the evidence of the eradication of clonal
              abnormalities. It should be emphasised that 2 of 15 patients
              developed ATRA syndrome during the early phases of the treatment
              with a feature of cardiorespiratory distress. The therapy with
              steroid was unsuccessful. Nine of 13 patients in ATRA group had
              moderate side effects with no necessity to discontinue the
              therapy. DISCUSSION: Our clinical trial shows for the first time
              in our county a beneficial effect of ATRA in addition to
              chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in newly diagnosed
              APL, thus comfirming the results of the European study group. The
              only flaw of in our study may come from the fact that the
              patients included in the study were not randomised and that for
              the comparison of the ATRA group were used previously treated
              patients with chemotherapy alone. However, we believe that this
              flaw has been overcome since uniform diagnostic procedure and
              particularly MIC classification were performed in all patients.
              In addition to that, all patients included in the trial were
              subjected to the analysis of haemostatic status as well as to
              precise biochemical studies, ECG and abdominal echography. It is
              interesting to note that in our study, similarity to the European
              study group, 13\% of patients developed ``ATRA syndrome''.
              Therefore, it is recommended that further effort should be made
              in order to prevent this fatal and not yet resolved syndrome.",

              investigated in 205 samples from patients with haematopoietic
              malignancies. These markers included thrombin/antithrombin III
              complex (TAT), D-dimer, plasmin/alpha 2plasmin inhibitor complex
              (PIC) and thrombomodulin (TM), and were assayed by EIA methods.
              Samples were divided into 4 groups according to the level of FDP:
              group A; FDP 10 greater than, group B; 10 less than or equal to
              less than 20 group C; 20 less than or equal to less than 40, and
              group D; less than 40. The mean level of each marker except TM
              increased in the order of group A, B, C and D. However, in many
              samples belonging to group A the plasma TAT or PIC levels and
              both were increased in spite of low FDP level. Furthermore,
              levels of TAT and PIC in several samples belonging to groups C
              and D were within the normal range. Also, the mean levels of each
              marker except TM increased in the order of 2, 3, 4, 5 and over 6
              points in DIC score according to the criteria of DIC diagnosis by
              the research committee on DIC of the Ministry of Health and
              Welfare in Japan. Eight of the 11 samples (72.7\%) obtained from
              cases with a DIC score of 3 points had high plasma levels of TAT,
              PIC and D-dimer. Plasma levels of these markers were increased
              after chemotherapy. These findings lead to the following
              conclusions: 1) FDP reflexed activation of coagulation and
              fibrinolysis, but 2) FDP was not more sensitive than TAT and PIC,
              and 3) the increase of FDP rarely resulted from fibrinogenolysis
              or non-plasmin mediated fibrinolysis. Furthermore, 4) TAT,
              D-dimer and PIC may serve as sensitive parameters of hemostatic
              activation in circulating blood and be valuable markers for early
              diagnosis of DIC.",

              during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide
              (AS(2)O(3)) treatment. METHODS: The plasma level of tissue factor
              (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor(TFPI), thrombin
              antithrombin complex(TAT), plasmin antiplasmin complex(PAP),

              technique that uses the dual characteristics of size and charge
              to isolate target macro- and micromolecules from complex
              biological solutions. It does this with high resolution and in
              rapid time. The mild buffers are used to assist in retaining
              biological activity of the isolated protein. Gradiflow technology
              employs a sandwich of three polyacrylamide membranes configured
              to allow passage of macromolecules ranging in size from 10 kDa to
              1,500 kDa. Fibrinogen was isolated from cryoprecipitate 1 using a
              single phase process. This separation was achieved within three
              hours with yields of 85\%. Purified fibrinogen was then
              characterized using biophysical characterization of fibrin clot
              structure and compared with clots derived from a commercially
              available product and human plasma. Significantly, clots
              developed from Gradiflow fibrinogen had characteristics closer to
              human plasma. Viral removal characteristics of the Gradiflow were
              investigated by spiking the source material (cryoprecipitate 1)
              with canine parvovirus and testing for its presence in the
              isolated fibrinogen using PCR. Parvo removal was found to be
              greater than 4 logs and was achieved during the purification
              process. The Gradiflow offers the advantage of large-scale
              separation of macromolecules and provides a new approach to
              fibrinogen separation that is quite distinct from other
              present-day technologies. The technology is capable of isolating
              protein with high purity, recovery, and functionality in
              combination with the removal of viruses during the purification.
              Furthermore, it is capable of integrating into present production

              (case 3), DD and DY/X fragments resulting from fibrinolysis
              accounted for the most part of the FDP fragments. In case 3, D
              fragments resulting from fibrinogenolysis were also observed to
              much less extent. In a DIC associated with acute myeloblastic
              leukemia (case 2), both fibrinolysis and fibrinogenolysis were
              increased and resulted in high levels of D, Y and DY/X fragments,

              an operation due to hepatocellular carcinoma, marked increase in
              DY/X and HMW fragments and slight increase in DD fragment were

              hypothesized that expression of coagulation proteins on blast
              membrane could determine the hemostatic balance on the surface of
              leukemic cells and may correlate with thrombotic manifestations.
              DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with newly
              diagnosed acute leukemia were enrolled over an 11-month period.
              Twenty-five of the patients had acute myeloid leukemia
              (AML)-M(0-2), 11 had AML-M3, 6 had AML-M(4-5), and 9 acute
              lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Peripheral blood and bone marrow were
              analyzed by flow-cytometry for tissue factor, protease-activated
              receptor 1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, urokinase
              plasminogen activator receptor, and thrombomodulin. RESULTS:
              Regardless of the leukemia subtype, tissue factor was
              predominantly present on leukemic blast surfaces as compared to
              protease-activated receptor 1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor,
              urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and thrombomodulin and
              it was significantly elevated (mean 63+/-6\%) in AML-M3 and
              AML-M(4-5) as compared to AML-M0(-2) and ALL (mean 37+/-4\%,
              p<0.001). Likewise, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
              expression was greater in AML-M(4-5) (49+/-11\%) than in in AML-
              M(0-2), M3 and, ALL (mean 17+/-3\%, p<0.001). Thrombotic
              manifestations were present in 13 out of 51 (26\%) patients. The
              tissue factor to urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ratio
              was higher in patients with a thrombotic event than in patients
              without thrombotic events (16+/-4 vs. 6+/-2, p=0.042).
              INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that
              tissue factor predominates on leukemic blast surface,
              particularly in M3 and M4-5 subtypes, while urokinase plasminogen
              activator receptor is increased on M4-5 blasts. The hemostatic
              balance on the blast surface may contribute to thrombotic
              manifestations in leukemic patients.",

              and {Rom{\'a}n M.{\'A}.} and {Canales M.} and {Yuste V.J.}",
  abstract = "Introduction: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous
              group of hematopoietic disorders with clonal bone marrow
              anomalies characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, morphologic
              and functional hematopoietic cells abnormalities, and an
              increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.
              Previous work from our lab has shown that MDS patients had an
              impairment in platelet activation, more externalization of
              phosphatidylserine (PS) indicating an increased platelet
              apoptosis and, in some cases, thrombocytopenia. However, these
              patients do not bleed at the frequency that would be expected
              taking into account these facts. Objective: The aim of this work
              was to identify the existence of some compensatory mechanisms
              that could be counteracting the expected bleeding tendency in
              these patients. Since apoptosis is accompanied by membrane
              blebbing and production of PS-exposing procoagulant
              microparticles (MP) shed from the plasma membrane, we assessed
              the thrombogenic capacity of MP and evaluate their correlation
              with exposure of PS. We also studied the ability of plasma to
              generate thrombin after stimulus. Methods: Seventy-five patients
              with MDS, 36\% female, mean age 77 years (range: 41 to 93 years)
              and sixty-eight healthy controls, 29\% female, mean age 52 years
              (range 20 to 76 years) were included. Whole blood was collected
              in citrated tubes and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min at 23°C
              to obtain platelet poor plasma (PPP). PPP was subjected to 2
              additional centrifugations at room temperature (first: 15 min at
              1,500 g and second: 2 min at 13,000 g) following SSC-ISTH
              recommendations to obtain platelet free plasma (PFP). MP
              procoagulant activity was determined in PFP with the ZYMUPHEN
              MP-Activity kit (HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville sur Oise, France).
              Plasma thrombin generation was measured using the Calibrated
              Automated Thrombogram (CAT) as described by Hemker at final
              concentration of 1pM tissue factor and 4 microM phospholipids.
              Four CAT parameters were recorded: endogenous thrombin potential
              (ETP, total amount of thrombin generated over time), lag time
              (time to the beginning of the explosive burst of thrombin
              generation), time to peak (TTP, time to reach the maximum
              thrombin concentration) and peak height (maximum thrombin
              concentration obtained). Apoptosis was determined by assessing
              the level of PS externalization by the binding of FITC-Annexin V
              to platelets by flow cytometry. Thrombocytopenia was defined as
              platelet count less than 50,000 platelets/microliter. Results:
              Platelet count in MDS patients varied from 4,000 to 478,000
              platelets/microliter. We observed an increased MP-associated
              procoagulant activity in MDS patients with thrombocytopenia
              compared to controls (p<0.05). This would be related to the
              increased apoptosis observed in platelets from MDS patients with
              thrombocytopenia (Spearman test r = 0.655, p <0.01). CAT
              evaluation of plasma procoagulant activity did not show
              differences between patients and controls in any of the measured
              parameters. Conclusions: Our results showed an increased
              procoagulant activity associated to plasma MPs in MDS with
              thrombocytopenia that might contribute to the minor risk of
              bleeding observed in these patients. However, further studies are
              necessary to assess the clinical significance of this finding.",

              administration, to study whether their changes may predispose to
              a haemorrhagic or thrombotic diathesis. The total level of alpha
              2-antiplasmin declined, as well as the ratio of the
              plasminogen-binding form of alpha 2-antiplasmin to the
              non-plasminogen-binding form. After cessation of L-asparaginase
              administration, the ratio increased to 1.6 times that of the
              pretreatment value. These data indicate that the
              plasminogen-binding form of alpha 2-antiplasmin is the form
              primarily synthesized in vivo. L-Asparaginase therapy reduced
              plasma levels of plasminogen and histidine-rich glycoprotein (
              HRG ) and influenced the equilibrium between HRG , plasminogen
              and HRG -plasminogen complex, with a more pronounced decrease of
              plasminogen (62\% +/- 8) and HRG (76\% +/- 11) in comparison to
              the free-plasminogen levels (51\% +/- 6). alpha 2-Macroglobulin
              was only slightly influenced by L-asparaginase and may
              consequently play a more pronounced role in inhibition. This is
              suggested by moderate declines in functional tests of plasmin,
              urokinase and tissue activator inhibition by patients plasma, and
              by the ratio of inhibition of these enzymes over alpha
              2-antiplasmin. Thus the bleeding tendency described during
              L-asparaginase therapy can be ascribed not only to a temporary

  abstract = "Platelets provide a useful system for studying Fc gamma
              receptor-mediated signaling events because these cells express
              only a single class of Fc gamma receptors and because platelet
              aggregation and secretion can be activated through Fc gamma
              receptor stimulation. We report here that stimulation of
              platelets by cross-linking antibodies to Fc gamma RII or by
              treatment with an anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody, which acts
              through Fc gamma RII, causes an induction of tyrosine
              phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins. Although the
              profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by
              stimulation of this Fc receptor was similar to that induced by
              thrombin, an additional 40-kDa phosphorylated protein was also
              detected. This protein co-migrated with Fc gamma RII and was
              immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to Fc gamma RII. In
              addition, after the cross-linking of Fc gamma RII in HEL cells or
              in COS-1 cells transfected with Fc gamma RII cDNA, the 40-kDa
              protein immunoprecipitated with anti-Fc gamma RII was also
              phosphorylated on tyrosine. These data strongly suggest that Fc
              gamma RII itself is a substrate for a tyrosine kinase(s)
              activated when Fc gamma RII is stimulated. Fc gamma RII was
              phosphorylated by the Src protein in vitro, suggesting that this
              kinase may be responsible for phosphorylation of Fc gamma RII in
              vivo. These studies establish that activation of platelets and
              human erythroleukemia cells through Fc gamma RII and CD9 involves
              an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins
              including Fc gamma RII itself and suggest that these
              phosphorylation events may be involved in Fc gamma RII-mediated
              cell signaling.",

              by venous sonography may identify patients who may benefit from
              anticoagulant therapy and thus may prevent morbidity and
              mortality associated with deep vein thrombosis. The aim of this
              study was to examine the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis by
              venous sonography in asymptomatic ambulatory patients with cancer
              undergoing chemotherapy and to evaluate the correlation between
              procoagulant activity and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis.
              METHODS: The study population included 62 patients (32 with lung
              cancer and 30 with lymphoma) receiving chemotherapy with an
              ambulatory performance status and without clinical evidence of
              deep vein thrombosis. Bilateral venous sonographic studies of the
              lower extremities were performed, covering the femoropopliteal
              venous system. The D-dimer level and acquired activated protein C
              resistance were determined in the patients and in 30 healthy
              control subjects. RESULTS: Sonographic evidence of deep vein
              thrombosis on the femoropopliteal axis was found in 0 (0\%) of 62
              patients (1-sided 95\% confidence interval, 0\%-4.8\%). Acquired
              activated protein C resistance prevalence and D-dimer levels were
              increased in study patients compared with control subjects (34\%

              respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the procoagulant tendency,
              venous sonography did not detect asymptomatic deep vein
              thrombosis in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Thus,
              screening by venous sonography is not justified in this patient

              disease is well recognized. There are distinctive features of the
              thrombotic and bleeding complications associated with specific
              hematologic malignancies. A number of procoagulants can initiate
              intravascular clotting including tissue factor, cancer
              procoagulant and interleukin-1. The hematologic malignancy most
              often associated with intravascular clotting and bleeding is
              acute promyelocytic leukemia. The pathogenesis of the
              life-threatening bleeding disorder associated with this uncommon
              subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is complex and involves
              disseminated intravascular coagulation, fibrinolysis and
              proteolysis. Both all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide
              result in relatively rapid resolution of the coagulopathy.
              Intravascular clotting may also be induced by hyperleukocytosis
              in AML and by the hyperviscosity syndrome observed in multiple
              myeloma and Waldenstr{\"o}m's macroglobulinemia. In the setting

              be excluded. Abnormal platelet production and function contribute

  author   = "Rodeghiero, F and Castaman, G",
  abstract = "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been historically
              characterized by a high rate of early hemorrhagic death,
              particularly from intracranial bleeding. The hemorrhagic
              complications have been attributed to a combination of
              intravascular thrombin generation, excessive fibrinolysis and/or
              proteolytic activities released from blast cells. Before the era
              of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the incidence of early fatal
              bleeding in recent series has ranged from 8 to 46\%, and no
              anti-hemorrhagic treatment clearly appeared superior in abating
              this complication. This uncertainty is due to remain because of
              the lack of prospective studies. The increasing awareness of the
              need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of APL and the larger
              availability of supportive therapy has largely contributed to
              lessen the incidence of fatal bleeding, which can be reliably
              estimated around 10\% in major centers. Groups pioneering the use
              of ATRA have reported a rapid improvement of the coagulopathy of
              APL, usually starting 48 h from the beginning of the treatment.
              However, the hemostatic changes during ATRA have been monitored
              only in a few patients and recent results suggest that
              hyperfibrinolysis/proteolysis is rapidly corrected by ATRA,
              whereas thrombin generation may persist longer. Moreover,
              although significantly less frequent, fatal bleeding may occur
              during ATRA and thrombotic events have also been reported so that
              hemostatic death rate is also approximately 10\% in patients
              treated with ATRA. The combination of chemotherapy plus ATRA
              administration during induction has been suggested as a useful
              means of controlling hyperleukocytosis, and this could contribute
              in abating this unacceptably high rate of early death. On the
              other side, chemotherapy can dramatically exacerbate clotting
              abnormalities leading to catastrophic clinical outcomes. Thus,
              more detailed studies of the coagulopathy of APL and its changes
              during treatment with ATRA, or ATRA combined with chemotherapy,
              are required in order to offer the most appropriate treatment to
              these patients still at risk of severe bleeding and thrombotic
              complications.",

              with myelofibrosis (MF). There is only indirect evidence
              indicating that the increased deposition of collagen in bone
              marrow matrix is a secondary phenomenon. A liquid culture system
              for cloning and growing bone marrow fibroblasts has permitted us
              to approach more directly the understanding of the pathogenesis
              of myelofibrosis by comparing the biophysical, growth, and
              functional characteristics of fibroblasts from normals, MPD
              patients without MF, and those with MF. In patients with MF,
              marrow fibroblast colony (CFU-F) formation could not be studied;
              fibroblasts were grown from marrow explants. CFU-E from normals
              and MPD patients exhibited similar cell density distribution and
              similar cell sedimentation rates. These similarities contrasted
              sharply with the differences seen when the erythroid and
              granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were studied by the same
              methods. There was a marked light density shift and a rapidly
              sedimenting shift of MPD hematopoietic colony-forming cells.
              Marrow fibroblasts from MPD patients with and without MF
              displayed the same in vitro growth characteristics as fibroblasts
              from normals. Both types of fibroblasts exhibited anchorage and
              serum dependence, and contact inhibition of growth. Marrow
              fibroblasts were also characterized for the presence and
              distribution of fibronectin and collagen types by
              immunofluorescent staining using monospecific antibodies.
              Extracellular matrix, membrane-, and cytoplasm-associated
              fibronectin, type I, type III, and type V collagen showed a
              similar staining pattern in both normal and myelofibrotic marrow
              fibroblasts. Plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity elicited
              from normal and myelofibrotic marrow fibroblasts were equivalent.
              Chromosomal analysis of hematopoietic cells and marrow
              fibroblasts from Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic
              myelocytic leukemia patients with and without MF showed that the
              Philadelphia chromosome was present only in hematopoietic cells.
              The results of these studies taken together demonstrate that bone
              marrow collagen-producing cells from MPD patients with and
              without MF behave in vitro as do those from normals. These
              findings support the hypothesis that that the marrow fibrosis
              observed in patients with MPD results from a reactive process
              rather than from a primary disorder affecting the marrow
              collagen-producing cells.",

  title    = "Familial dysfibrinogenemia and thrombophilia. Report on a study
              of the {SSC} Subcommittee on Fibrinogen",
  author   = "Haverkate, F and Samama, M",
  abstract = "Approximately 250 cases of dysfibrinogenemia have been reported;
              55\% were asymptomatic (detected by chance), 25\% had a tendency
              to bleeding, and 20\% were reported to have a tendency to
              thrombosis. To establish a possible association between familial
              dysfibrinogenemia and thrombophilia, data on cases with both
              affections were collected in a study within the framework of the
              SSC Subcommittee on Fibrinogen of the International Society on
              Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Registry forms of 51 cases were
              received. Twenty-six cases fulfilled the (arbitrarily chosen)
              criteria of familial dysfibrinogenemia and of thrombosis not due
              to other causes. Protein C and protein S deficiency and APC
              resistance as a cause of thrombosis could not be excluded in
              probands on anticoagulants or investigated before the discovery
              of the assays. The prevalence of dysfibrinogenemia in patients
              with a history of venous thrombosis is low, i.e. 0.8\%, as
              deduced from 9 studies in 7 countries on 2376 patients. The 26
              cases fulfilling the criteria are characterized by predominantly
              venous thrombosis at a young age. Severe bleeding was rare and
              limited to bleeding post partum. Homozygosity was established in
              2 cases (Marburg and Naples), hypodysfibrinogenemia (less than
              1.5 mg antigen per ml) in 5 cases. A high incidence of problems
              related to pregnancy, in particular thrombosis post partum and
              spontaneous abortions was noted amongst the 15 women with
              thrombophilic dysfibrinogen. An association between
              dysfibrinogenemia and thrombophilia is indicated by studies on
              relatives of the 26 probands. Analysis of 187 investigated family
              members showed that thrombophilia affected 20 persons exclusively
              in the group of 99 relatives with dysfibrinogenemia, no
              thrombosis was reported in the group of 88 relatives without the
              defect. Convincing evidence for such an association became
              apparent for only 5 individual propositi of whom 2 or more family
              members had both the defect and thrombotic episodes at a young
              age (Caracas V, Frankfurt IV/Vlissingen, Melun, Naples and Paris
              V, also named Dusart). Mainly two mechanisms to explain
              thrombosis as a consequence of malfunctioning fibrinogen have
              been suggested: a) A defective binding of thrombin to abnormal
              fibrin which leads to increased thrombin levels (Malm{\"o},
              Naples, New York I, Pamplona II, Poitiers), b) A defective
              stimulatory function of abnormal fibrin in the t-PA mediated
              fibrinolysis (Argenteuil, Chapel Hill III, Date, New York I,

              variety of underlying disorders, and criteria for diagnosis are
              not well defined. However, the most helpful are a low platelet
              count, positive plasma protamine test, and fibrinogen and fibrin
              degradation product levels viewed in the context of the patient's
              underlying disease. The cornerstone of therapy is prompt
              treatment of the underlying disease and elimination of the
              trigger mechanism. Additional treatment must be individualized,

              requires an invasive procedure, then replacement with the

              complication in acute leukemia, although its real incidence is
              unknown. The best treatment of this complication is still a
              matter of debate due to the very high risk of hemorrhage in this
              group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 2000 to
              December 2002 four Caucasian patients with acute leukemia
              developed VTE complications. The patients were three men and one
              woman, mean age 55.7 years (range, 27-77). Two patients with
              acute lymphoid leukemia (L1 and L2 according to the FAB
              classification) developed deep venous thrombosis during the
              administration of chemotherapy; one patient with acute myeloid
              leukemia (AML, M2 according to the FAB classification) had
              pulmonary thromboembolism at diagnosis, while another AML patient
              (M4 according to FAB) showed deep venous thrombosis as the first
              symptom of leukemia. The clinical diagnosis of symptomatic VTE
              was confirmed by objective imaging procedures including lower
              limb venous color Doppler imaging in all cases and a
              ventilation-perfusion lung scan in one case. All patients were
              treated with enoxaparin 100 IU/kg subcutaneously twice daily for
              one month, followed by 150 IU/kg once daily for at least five
              months. When the platelet count was below 20,000 x 10(9)/L, the
              dose was reduced by 50\%. RESULTS: During antithrombotic
              treatment neither VTE recurrences nor hemorrhagic complications
              or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia occurred. The platelet count
              at the beginning of enoxaparin treatment was very low (mean,
              55,750 x 109/L; range, 12,000-121,000 x 10(9)/L) and treatment
              did not affect platelet recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Enoxaparin proved
              to be efficacious and safe in the management of deep venous
              thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism in patients
              affected by acute leukemia. Enoxaparin cured acute venous
              thrombosis, prevented recurrences and did not cause any
              hemorrhagic complications despite prolonged severe
              thrombocytopenia.",

              analysed. RESULTS: Increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
              hyponatremia was found in all of the patients. Prolonged
              prothrombin time, hypofibrinogenemia, hyertriglyceridemia, and

              Leukemia (FPD/AML) has been attributed to abnormalities of the
              RUNX1 gene, located at human chromosome 21q22. The protein
              product of this gene forms a critical component of the core
              binding factor (CBF) complex, which is required for normal
              hematopoiesis. Truncating mutations and deletions of RUNX1
              (particularly in exons 3, 4, and 5, encoding the DNA binding and
              CBF-beta interaction domains) that result in haploinsufficiency
              or dominant-negative activity have been identified as the genetic
              mechanisms underlying FPD/AML. Clinically, these patients present
              with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction,
              bleeding, and about a 35\% risk of developing AML. We report on
              three unrelated families who share histories of autosomal
              dominant thrombocytopenia over two to five generations, bleeding,
              platelet aggregation defects, and development of myelodysplastic
              syndrome, AML or intriguingly, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
              Detailed genetic interrogation of the RUNX1 locus in the proband
              from each family, including complete sequencing of all 8 exons,
              flanking 50 base pair regions, and P1 and P2 promoters, as well
              as gene dosage studies, failed to demonstrate a causative lesion
              in the RUNX1 gene. Our findings strongly suggest that genetic
              loci other than RUNX1 are involved in some cases of autosomal
              dominant thrombocytopenia with a predisposition to both AML and
              CML. Identification of the disease-causing genes in these
              families will allow for prospective testing of family members,
              appropriate surveillance and early intervention in affected
              individuals, and potentially new molecular insights into
              leukemogenesis. We have broadened the genotype-phenotype
              correlation in FPD/AML beyond the RUNX1 gene and suggest that
              this syndrome may be more genetically heterogeneous than
              initially described.",

              translocation between chromosome 17 and chromosome 15 t (15; 17)

              related to a primary fibrinolysis. The high percentage of early
              deaths, around 20\% experienced by APL patients, is generally due
              to the haemorrhagic syndrome. A new feature is the highly

              generated by mononuclear cells after incubation for 20 h at 37

              (p = 0.027). In all samples it was identified as tissue factor by

              medium obtained from patients' mononuclear cells after incubation
              for 20 h at 37 degrees C contained significantly higher amounts
              of PAI activity and PAI-2 antigen than control samples (p <

              gaps, we performed a retrospective real-life analysis. We
              retrospectively assessed 949 patients treated for multiple
              myeloma or plasma cell leukemia at three Italian cancer centers
              in the years 1979-2014. Clinical features at the time of
              diagnosis were consistent with what was observed in clinical
              routine. A total of 39\% of patients underwent high-dose
              chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation
              (ASCT). The median overall survival (OS) of the whole group was
              5.4 years and ranged from 3.4 years for patients who did not
              receive at least one of the new drugs compared to 5.9 years in
              the other patients (p<0.001). The improvement in OS due to
              administration of new drugs was also observed among different
              prognostic sub-groups such as age, Durie and Salmon stage,
              international staging system and renal impairment. Availability
              of new drugs significantly improved survival of patients who
              underwent ASCT and also those who did not. In conclusion, we
              provided evidence that the advent of the new drugs drastically
              improved the outcome of patients with MM, also in cases with poor
              risk at the time of diagnosis. ASCT is still of major importance
              in the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, MM remains
              incurable and new therapeutic approaches are warranted.",

              to an abnormal expression of TF by blast cells and/or to an
              abnormal fibrinolytic response. In this study the expression of
              TF and uPAR has been assessed in 18 acute non-lymphoblastic and 8
              lymphoblastic leukemic blast cells using several methodological
              approaches. TF mRNA was evaluated by in situ hybridization and TF
              and uPAR antigen were evaluated immunologically in cell lysates
              and on the cell surface by flow cytometry. In addition,
              TF-procoagulant activity was measured in coagulation-based
              assays. The reliability of these methods was corroborated in six
              leukemic cell lines of different lineages and states of
              maturation. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was detected
              in two M3 leukemia patients whose blast cells expressed high
              amounts of TF. Hyperfibrinolysis was detected in one M1 and two
              M2 patients, whose blast cells displayed a high content of uPAR
              antigen, but no TF. Furthermore, M5 leukemia blast cells
              expressed both TF and uPAR, although no hemostatic defects or
              bleeding complications were detected in these patients. Taken
              together, although a limited number of patients was included in
              this study, these data suggest that in leukemia patients
              exhibiting bleeding, either TF or uPAR are expressed by their
              blast cells. However, the presence of these receptors does not
              necessarily imply the existence of a hemostatic disorder.",

              freezing and thawing, and then assayed for procoagulant activity
              (PCA), elastase activity, tissue factor (TF) antigen, tissue-type
              plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and urokinase-type
              plasminogen activator (u-PA) antigen. PCA was determined by a
              recalcification assay. Elastase was measured by an amidolytic
              assay (S-2484). TF, t-PA, and u-PA antigens were measured by an
              enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Malignant
              promyelocytes isolated from the patients had increased levels of
              PCA and TF as compared with the control polymorphonucleates, and
              low levels of elastase, t-PA, and u-PA; the patient blast PCA
              level was significantly related to the degree of
              hypofibrinogenemia. In this system, blast PCA depended on the
              tissue factor and was significantly correlated to the TF antigen
              values. In the cultures without ATRA, PCA, TF, and u-PA
              progressively increased, whereas elastase and t-PA levels
              remained essentially unchanged. In the presence of ATRA, all
              parameters (except u-PA) decreased during the culture time. Thus,
              a major role of the promyelocytic blast cell PCA in the
              pathogenesis of M3-related coagulopathy is suggested; the ATRA
              effect on coagulopathy seems mainly mediated by a downregulation

              METHODS: We investigated 22 patients with CML aged 38-55 years
              (median 45.0). Twenty nine healthy controls were sex and
              age-matched. Patients underwent following examination: whole

              activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), euglobulin lysis

              concentrations, antitrombin (AT) and alpha2-antiplasmin
              (alpha2-AP) activity. RESULTS: TAT concentration (35.46 ng/ml)
              was significantly higher in examined group than in controls (3.41
              ng/ml). Significantly higher fibrinogen concentration (3.31 g/l)
              and elevated platelet count (611.0 G/1) was observed in patients
              with CML. We also showed significantly higher concentrations of

              myelogenous leukaemia (BP) when two important risk factors that
              worsen the prognosis are simultaneously present: low
              thrombocytopenia and hyperleukocytosis. Clinical and post-mortem
              neuropathological examination was performed in 143 patients, aged
              17-76 years, who died from AML (80 cases), BP (38), and ALL (25).
              Periods with co-existence of thrombocytopenia below 25 x 10(9)
              per l and hyperleukocytosis above 100 x 10(9) per l were
              identified after plotting the results and were termed the
              'critical period' (CP). The study showed that the risk of death
              was disproportionately high during the CP. This finding was
              obtained in all patient groups, although it involved mainly
              patients with AML and BP, i.e. leukaemias with the highest
              frequency of hyperleukocytosis in peripheral blood. It is
              suggested that the risk of death during the CP is so high because
              leukaemic cells are a potent synergistic factor to
              thrombocytopenia in causing CNS haemorrhage. When a CP is
              detected, hyperleukocytosis and thrombocytopenia should be
              controlled and treated aggressively: leukapheresis and platelet
              concentrates should be administered. Patients with CP should not
              be given packed red blood cells, in order to avoid a further
              increase in blood viscosity, which is already high due to
              hyperleukocytosis. In fact, anaemia during the CP should be
              regarded as a potentially life-saving factor.",

              are at risk of bleeding. The risk factors for different
              severities of bleeding are poorly studied. DESIGN AND METHODS:
              Data from Rebulla et al. were analyzed in an exploratory analysis
              using multivariate Cox regression analyses for time-to-first
              bleed with time-depend- ent covariates reflecting measures of
              clinical and laboratory variables on the previous day. The
              relationships of the variables with three bleeding categories
              were studied: mild bleeding (WHO grades 1 and 2) clinically
              significant (bleeding grades 2, 3 and 4) and severe (bleeding
              grades 3 and 4). RESULTS: Bleeding of any severity occurred in
              149 (58.4\%) of 255 patients. There were 743 days of bleeding
              over 7335 patient-days of observation. Risk factors for mild
              bleeding included increased body temperature and decreased
              platelet count; the risk was decreased with administration of
              antifungal medication or platelet transfusion on the previous
              day. Risk factors for clinically significant bleeding included
              grade 1 bleeding on the previous day, decreased platelet count
              and elevated body temperature. Decreased platelet count and mild
              bleeding on the previous day were risk factors for severe
              bleeding. Higher hemoglobin values were associated with a delay
              in the time-to-first clinically significant bleed. INTERPRETATION
              AND CONCLUSIONS: These results support clinical guidelines for
              increasing the platelet transfusion threshold in the presence of
              fever and support the use of milder bleeding symptoms as an
              outcome in clinical trials. The suggestion that hemo- globin
              concentration maybe predictive of bleeding risk supports the
              hypothesis that this maybe a valuable intervention in anemic
              thrombocytopenic patients at high risk of bleeding.",

              thrombasthenia, which lack GPIIb and IIIa, expressed IAP as well

              intracellular Ca2+ elevation after stimulation was influenced by

              two polypeptide chains of GPIIb are described. A number of clones
              were isolated from $\lambda$gt11 libraries constructed with mRNA
              from an erythroleukemic cell line, HEL, and human megakaryocytes.
              Two of these clones, $\lambda$IIb1, from HEL cells, and
              $\lambda$IIb2, from megakaryocytes, cross-hybridized and were
              selected for detailed analysis. The identification of these as
              authentic GPIIb clones was based on immunological criteria and
              confirmed by the presence of nucleotide sequences in each insert
              encoding for known protein sequences of platelet GPIIb. These
              clones contained inserts of 1.54 kb and 1.39 kb, respectively,
              with an overlapping sequence of 801 bp. The nucleotide sequence
              of the overlapping region was identical indicating that HEL cells
              produce a protein closely related, if not identical, to platelet
              GPIIb. The determined nucleotide sequence of two inserts included
              a coding sequence for 648 amino acid residues, a TAG stop codon
              and 185 nucleotides of 3' non-coding sequence followed by a
              poly(A) tail. The coding sequence contained a portion of the
              heavy chain, the junction between the heavy and light chains and
              the entire light chain including a potential
              transmembrane-spanning domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. When
              these cDNA were used to probe for GPIIb mRNA, a single mRNA
              species of 3.9 kb was identified in both HEL cells and human
              megakaryocytes. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence
              for GPIIb with those of the $\alpha$ subunit of the vitronectin
              and the fibronectin receptors revealed extensive homologies.
              These homologies further establish that GPIIb-IIIa from
              platelets, together with the vitronectin and the fibronectin

  abstract = "Background: Platelet activation is critical during inflammation,
              thrombosis, and tumor progression and metastasis. This activation
              leads to platelet-monocyte aggregation, platelet P-selectin, and
              CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression. Platelets can increase acute
              myelogenous leukemia (AML) blast proliferation. Cilostazol is
              widely used for arteriosclerosis obliterans and is known to
              inhibit platelet function. We hypothesized that cilostazol
              preconditioning impairs subsequent AML blast proliferation
              through a reduction in platelet activation. We aim to determine
              the effects of cilostazol on platelet activation as measured by
              platelet-monocyte aggregation, platelet P-selectin, and CD40L
              expression. Methods: Platelet-rich plasma samples from healthy
              volunteers were treated with cilostazol. THP1 is a human AML cell
              line that resembles human monocytes, which was used as a model to
              measure platelet-monocyte aggregation. The blood samples were
              stimulated by adenosine diphosphate (8 $\mu$ M) for evaluation of
              platelet-monocytic THP1 cell aggregation and P-selectin
              expression and were stimulated by thrombin (0. 1 U/mL) for
              detecting CD40L expression. All samples were stained with
              fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and were analyzed by flow
              cytometry. Results: Pretreatment with cilostazol significantly
              suppressed platelet-monocytic THP1 cell aggregation, P-selectin,
              and CD40L expression in a concentration-dependent manner at
              concentrations of 101, 102, and 103 mM, respectively.
              Conclusions: Our data showed that cilostazol can downregulate not
              only cellular interactions between platelets and monocytic THP1
              cells but also platelet P-selectin and CD40L expression.

  author   = "Hajjar, Katherine A",
  abstract = "Annexin A2 is a multicompartmental protein that orchestrates a
              spectrum of dynamic membrane-related events. At cell surfaces, A2
              forms the (A2•S100A10)2 complex which accelerates tissue
              plasminogen activator-dependent activation of the fibrinolytic
              protease, plasmin. Anti-A2 antibodies are associated with
              clinical thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome, whereas
              overexpression of A2 promotes hyperfibrinolytic bleeding in acute
              promyelocytic leukemia. A2 is upregulated in hypoxic tissues, and
              mice deficient in A2 are resistant to hypoxia-related retinal
              neovascularization in a model of diabetic retinopathy. Within the
              cell, A2 regulates membrane fusion processes involved in the
              secretion of pre-packaged, ultra-large molecules. In stimulated
              dendritic cells, A2 maintains lysosomal membrane integrity,
              thereby modulating inflammasome activation and cytokine
              secretion. Together, these findings suggest an emerging,
              multifaceted role for annexin A2 in human health and disease. The

              reactions on the effectiveness of platelet transfusions is not
              known. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Platelet transfusion reactions,
              identified by prospective monitoring, were analyzed for the
              effects of component type, recipient lymphocytotoxic antibodies,
              bacterial contamination, and duration of storage. Posttransfusion
              corrected count increments (CCIs) were used to evaluate the
              effectiveness of transfusions associated with reactions by
              comparing them to those of randomly selected transfusions without
              reactions. RESULTS: Reactions accompanied 4 percent of the 4926
              transfusions given and included 119 febrile nonhemolytic
              transfusion reactions, 62 allergic reactions, and 13 reactions
              with features of both. Platelet concentrates contained a mean of
              0.5 x 10(8) white cells per unit. Lymphocytotoxic antibodies were
              detectable in 20 of 84 recipients tested proximate to a reaction.
              Bacterial cultures from 4 of 81 units were positive; 1 unit was
              associated with fatal Enterobacter sp. sepsis. The incidence of
              febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions but not allergic
              reactions was related to platelet storage duration. The CCI was
              not significantly different for transfusions associated with
              reactions (10.97 [median, range 0-72.5; n = 165]) or not so
              associated (13.1 [median, range 0-39.5; n = 174]) (p = 0.08).
              CONCLUSION: The incidence of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion
              reactions but not allergic reactions appears to be related to the
              duration of platelet storage. Transfusion reactions may not have
              an adverse impact on the effectiveness of platelet transfusions.",

              significantly higher in patients with DIC than in either
              hospitalized control subjects or normal individuals in most
              disease categories studied. Highest t-PA antigen levels were seen
              in patients with liver disease, but patients with DIC without
              liver disease also had significantly elevated t-PA antigen.
              Detectable free t-PA activity was infrequently seen in patients
              with DIC, however. No correlation was found with either
              thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications and levels of t-PA
              antigen or activity in DIC, with the possible exception of
              increased t-PA activity in two patients with intracranial
              hemorrhage. Bleeding complications were seen almost exclusively
              in patients with underlying anatomic lesions, and thrombotic
              complications were usually associated with other known
              predisposing factors. We conclude that t-PA antigen is usually
              elevated in DIC, but free t-PA activity is infrequently seen,
              most likely because of increased levels of t-PA inhibitor. The
              presence or absence of free t-PA activity does not appear to
              predict which patients with DIC will develop hemorrhage or
              thrombosis.",

              in AML-M4eo but can cause ARF. In the absence of Discussion:
              overt infection or hemorrhage, prompt diagnosis should be
              established by BALF analysis, and treatment with HU should be
              initiated immediately as was the case in our patient. The
              mechanisms underlying the salutary effects of HU in
              leukocytoclastic-associated ARDS are uncertain. They may be
              related, in part, to local HU-dependent elaboration of nitric
              oxide leading to reversal of leukocyte adhesion to pulmonary
              microvascular endothelium and platelet aggregation along with
              improved ventilation/perfusion matching. Conceivably, HU could
              also down-regulate key pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
              necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$), and up-regulate
              anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), in
              the lung thereby promoting tissue repair. We suggest that HU
              should be further evaluated as novel treatment for
              leukocytoclastic-associated ARDS.",

              [14C]arachidonate from prelabeled phospholipids including

              alkylacetyl-GPC biosynthesis by HL60 cells and that these
              activities appear during differentiation. However, when measured

              indistinguishable from those of differentiated cells. Uninduced
              cells exhibited enhanced incorporation of [3H]alkyllyso-GPC or

              phosphorus determination showed no significant alterations in
              phospholipid composition of HL60 cells during differentiation.
              Together these data are suggestive that mechanisms regulating the
              activation of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase activities
              are defective in uninduced cells and that an increased

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The standard evaluation of haemoptysis in a
              department of respiratory medicine would currently consist of
              chest radiography, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and
              fibre-optic bronchoscopy (FOB), regardless of the result of the
              CT. Our aim was to evaluate whether patients presenting with
              haemoptysis but no positive finding on a contrast-enhanced CT of
              the chest are at risk for having serious disease, first of all
              lung cancer, and thus whether FOB is mandatory for such patients.
              METHODS: We searched the literature and retrospectively reviewed
              all records of patients referred with haemoptysis between 2000
              and 2010 at the Department of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy,
              Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. RESULTS: A total of 379
              patient records were reviewed for inclusion in the clinical part
              of the study. Of these, 269 had the information required for the
              study and had been examined with CT. In all, 16 of the 269
              patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. In all of these, a
              tumour or other findings indicating a possible tumour were seen
              on the chest CT. No additional cases of lung cancer were
              discovered during FOB, and no cases had been missed by the CT.
              CONCLUSION: CT should be used as first-line examination in
              patients with a history of haemoptysis. Furthermore, in patients
              above 40 years of age with positive findings of any kind on the
              CT, further examination with FOB is indicated. However, if the
              chest CT is without pathological findings, it is most unlikely
              that FOB will reveal anything of significance. FUNDING: none.

              confusion for the diagnosis of diseases. We investigated five
              different automated instruments using blood samples from
              different patients with hematological disorders to evaluate the
              flow of these automated counters in the interpretation of test
              results. Platelet aggregation, hemolysis and cryoglobulin can
              influence the evaluation with such automated instruments. The
              degree of the variance is different between false value and
              corrected value. Furthermore, cryoglobulin may give false data on
              coagulation and fibrinolysis tests. Automated white cell
              differentiation is based upon flow system or pattern recognition,
              but overlooking of the abnormal cells cannot be avoided by either
              method, such as a small number of blasts, atypical lymphocytes,
              adult T-cell leukemia cell, etc. Therefore, it is necessary of
              the bases is blood cell to the CD4/CD8 measurement and
              microscopic check along with considering biochemical parameters.
              We should make smears from such patients. For analysis of surface
              markers of hematological malignancy cell by flow cytometry proper
              selection of antibodies and setting of gate are required. To
              prevent mistakes due to morphological misinterpretation or other
              unsuitable conditions, we should thoroughly understand the
              morphologic aspects of leukemia cells.",

              gene expressions, RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
              reaction) to identify transcribed fusion messages, and PCR-SSCR
              (single strand conformation polymorphism) to detect mutated
              genes. Rearrangements within major Bcr (breakpoint cluster
              region) were observed in almost all cases in chronic myelogenous
              leukemia, and breakpoint were found within minor Bcr in
              Philadelphia-positive leukemia. The rearrangements within the

              investigated. Streptokinase induced localization of human IgG to
              the platelet surface, platelet aggregation, and thromboxane A(2)
              production. These effects were inhibited by a monoclonal antibody
              to the platelet Fc receptor, IV.3. The platelet response to
              streptokinase was also blocked by an antibody directed against
              the cleavage site of the platelet thrombin receptor,
              protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), but not by hirudin or an
              active site thrombin inhibitor, Ro46-6240. In plasma depleted of
              plasminogen, exogenous wild-type plasminogen, but not an inactive
              mutant protein, S(741)A plasminogen, supported platelet
              aggregation, suggesting that the protease cleaving PAR-1 was
              streptokinase-plasminogen. Streptokinase-plasminogen cleaved a
              synthetic peptide corresponding to PAR-1, resulting in generation
              of PAR-1 tethered ligand sequence and selectively reduced binding

              hypertriglyceridemia and hypofibrinogenemia. Primary genetic form
              and secondary HS associated with infections, malignancies or
              autoimmune disorders can be distinguished. Untreated HS in most
              cases leads to death. We analyzed retrospectively 7 cases of HS
              in children (3 girls, 4 boys; aged 10 days -14 years) treated in
              3 different pediatric centers from 2004 to 2009. In 3 cases HS
              was associated with infections (EBV, CMV, Bacillus Calmette
              Guerin - BCG), in 1 child with non-Hodgkin anaplastic large cell
              lymphoma (ALCL), in 1 patients probably with side effect of
              antiepileptic drug. In 2 cases cause of HS remained unknown.
              Fever, hepatomegaly, pan- or bicytopenia and hyperferritinemia
              were present in all children. In addition, splenomegaly was noted
              in 6 cases, hemophagocytosis in 6 children, impaired function or
              decreased number of NK cells in 4 cases, hypofibrino-genemia in 5
              and hypotriglyceridemia in 4 patients. Among other symptoms and
              signs we observed: lymphadenopathy, hepatic failure, oedema,
              rash, neurological symptoms, increased level of LDH and
              inflammatory markers. In one child acute pancreatitis occurred.
              Among others, antibiotics, antiviral and immunosuppressive drugs
              were used in therapy. HLH-2004 protocol was applied in 4 cases.
              Patient with ALCL was treated with chemotherapy and allogeneic
              stem cell transplantation. Four patients are alive, 2 died
              because of HS, child with ALCL died because of generalized
              infection in peritrans-plantation period. In case of prolonged
              fever, splenomegaly and cytopenia diagnosis of HS should be
              considered. Following tests are recommended: complete blood
              count, ferritin, triglycerides, fibrinogen, bone marrow
              aspiration and NK cell assessment. Patients should be also
              screened for infections and malignancies. Early diagnosis of HS

  abstract = "Background: Platelet transfusion is a cornerstone of the care in
              hematologic patients. Though the beneficial effect of platelet
              transfusion on hemostasis is well established, there is emerging
              evidence that platelet transfusion induces an inflammatory
              response in vascular endothelial cells. Aims: To investigate
              functional whole blood hemostasis and circulating levels of
              endothelial biomarkers before and after platelet transfusion in
              patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), hypothesizing that
              platelet transfusion would improve hemostasis but also cause a
              measurable change in endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers.
              Methods: Blood were sampled from AML patients immediately before
              and 1- and 24 hours after platelet transfusion. Remnant samples
              from the transfused platelet products were also collected. Blood
              samples from 31 healthy blood donors served as controls. Primary
              and secondary hemostasis was evaluated by whole blood impedance
              aggregometry (Multiplate) and thromboelastography (TEG). Samples
              were analyzed for biomarkers of endothelial activation (sICAM-1),
              damage (syndecan-1, sThrombomodulin (sTM)) and integrity
              (sVECadherin) and of platelet activation (sCD40L, TGF-$\beta$) by
              ELISA. Blood counts, standard coagulation tests and HsCRP were
              measured as routine. Bleeding symptoms on the day of study
              inclusion were assessed according to the WHO bleeding score
              (grade 1-4). Results: 21 patients with AML and 1 patient with
              high-risk-MDS were included in the study. Median age was 55
              years. Pre-transfusion median platelet count increased from 10
              109/L to 33 and 26 109/L, 1 and 24 hours after transfusion,
              respectively. Despite continued low platelet counts, platelet
              transfusion normalized the median values of all investigated TEG
              parameters. Platelet aggregation before and after transfusion
              also improved, but did not normalize (all p<0.05). Considering
              circulating biomarkers, sVE-Cadherin, reflecting endothelial
              junction function, was reduced (2214 vs. 2049 ng/mL) whereas the
              platelet activation marker sCD40L was 3-fold increased 1 hour
              after transfusion (33 vs. 91 pg/mL) (both p<0.05). Compared to
              healthy individuals, AML patients had higher sTM, sICAM-1 and
              HsCRP and lower sCD40L pre-transfusion levels. The change in
              platelet count (1h $\delta$-value) correlated negatively with the
              corresponding change in sVE-Cadherin (Figure 1A), indicating that
              higher platelet count was associated with decreased sVE-Cadherin
              shedding i.e. improved endothelial junction function. The change
              in platelet count correlated positively with that of sCD40L
              (Figure 1B), indicating that higher platelet count was associated
              with increased sCD40L (both p<0.05). Interestingly, the 1h sCD40L
              level correlated positively with Syndecan-1 (24h $\delta$ value)
              and sTM (1h $\delta$ value), biomarkers of endothelial glycocalyx
              and cell damage, indicating that high sCD40L levels disrupted the
              endothelium (Figure 1C and D). Six patients (27\%) were
              transfused because of bleeding symptoms (all WHO grade 1) and the
              level of TGF-$\beta$ was significantly higher in patients with
              bleeding both before and 1 hour after transfusion compared to
              patients with no bleeding (n=16). The level of TGF-$\beta$ in the
              transfusion products correlated to the post-transfusion change in
              the biomarker. Summary and Conclusions: Platelet transfusion and
              the increase in platelet count improved hemostatic function and
              vascular integrity, the latter assessed by lower sVE-Cadherin. In
              contrast, the post-transfusion level of sCD40L correlated with
              biomarkers of endothelial damage. These findings indicate that
              transfused platelets and platelet-derived pro-inflammatory
              mediators have opposite directed effects on the endothelium.

              increased risks: Promyeloblastic leukemia, high blast count, low

              a large intervening sequence, and a C-terminal LIM domain and was

              that CLP36 associates with actin filaments and stress fibers that
              are formed during shape change and spreading of platelets and
              during migration and contraction of endothelial cells. CLP36
              binds to alpha-actinin-1 as shown by coimmunoprecipitation,
              pull-down experiments, yeast 2-hybrid analysis, and blot overlay
              assays and colocalizes with alpha-actinin-1 along endothelial
              actin stress fibers. In contrast to alpha-actinin-1, CLP36 was
              absent from focal adhesions in both activated platelets and
              endothelial cells. The N-terminal part of CLP36 containing the

              demonstrated that the intervening sequence, but not the PDZ or
              the LIM domain of CLP36, binds to the spectrinlike repeats 2 and
              3 of alpha-actinin-1. The study further shows that CLP36 binds to
              alpha-actinin in resting platelets and translocates as a
              CLP36/alpha-actinin complex to the newly formed actin
              cytoskeleton in activated platelets. The results indicate that

              cell-line cells are susceptible to differentiation to either a
              more mature granulocytic or monocytic form, we were able to study
              the hypothesis that the combination of PCA and proteolytic

              severe coagulopathy seen in patients with acute promyelocytic

              retinoic acid or DMSO led to a diminished PCA, while not
              affecting the fibrinolytic activity. On the other hand, monocytic
              differentiation obtained by culturing the cells in the presence

              simultaneously stained for alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2-AP), the
              main physiological inhibitor of fibrinolysis and in a number of
              nodular areas they were also labelled for plasmin(ogen). The
              detection of alpha 2-antiplasmin-plasmin complex-neoantigen

               Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD, over the last 10
               years. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis on
               2942 patients looking at the frequency of serious bleeding as a
               function of platelet count and numerous features that may
               correlate with hemorrhage. Multivariate analyses showed no
               relationship between either the first morning platelet count or
               the lowest platelet count of the day and the risk of hemorrhage.
               Of the other features we examined, several correlated
               independently with bleeding, including uremia (odds ratio [OR]
               1.64; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.40 to 1.92),
               hypoalbuminemia (OR 1.54; 95\% CI, 1.33 to 1.79), recent bone
               marrow transplantation (OR 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.22 to 1.43), and

              ability of fibrin (1) to bind thrombin at a nonsubstrate site,
              thus limiting its diffusability but at the same time preserving
              its catalytic potential; (2) to bind fXIII, regulate its
              activation to fXIIIa, and limit further activation of fXIII once

              recently to facilitate the rate and the extent of pharmacological
              thrombolysis. However, their synergistic potential with rtPA in
              dissolving thrombotic vaso-occlusions is not fully understood. We
              have therefore developed a dynamic and structural approach for
              analysis of fibrinolysis to assess the inhibiting effect of
              platelets and the facilitating effect of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in
              dissolving platelet-rich clots (PRCs). Fluorescent rtPA was used
              to study the architecture of PRCs, to follow the progression of
              the rtPA binding front, and to measure the lysis-front velocity
              using confocal microscopy. Fibrinolysis resistance of PRCs was
              related to a reduction of both rtPA binding and lysis-front
              velocities of platelet-rich areas compared with platelet-poor
              areas (2.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.5 +/- 0.4 microm/min for rtPA binding
              velocity, P=0.04, and 1.2 +/- 0.6 versus 2.8 +/- 0.2 microm/min
              for lysis-front velocity, P=0.008, in platelet-rich and
              platelet-poor areas, respectively). Fibrinolysis appeared
              heterogeneous, leaving platelet-rich areas un-lysed. Adding
              pharmacological concentrations of abciximab (0.068 micromol/L) or
              eptifibatide (1 micromol/L) before clotting decreased the average
              surface of platelet-rich areas by 64\% (P=0.0005) and 72\%
              (P=0.0007), respectively. The resulting equalization of rtPA
              binding rate and rtPA binding-front velocity between
              platelet-rich and platelet-poor areas led to a 3-fold increase of
              the lysis-front velocity in platelet-rich areas of either
              abciximab-PRC (P=0.006) or eptifibatide-PRC (P=0.03). The overall
              lysis rate of treated-PRC was increased by 74\% compared with
              control-PRC (P<0.01). These results demonstrate that fibrinolysis
              resistance of PRCs is related primarily to the heterogeneity in
              the clot structure between platelet-rich and platelet-poor areas.
              GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors facilitate the rate and the extent of
              fibrinolysis by improving rtPA binding velocity and,
              subsequently, the lysis rate in platelet-rich areas. These

  abstract = "Platelets are lost from circulation by 2 mechanisms: senescence
              and random loss. Approximately 7.1 x 10(3) platelets/microL/d are
              postulated to be randomly used in maintaining vascular integrity.
              Thus, in clinically stable patients, major bleeding is unusual
              unless the platelet count is </=5 x 10(3)/microL. Risk factors
              for bleeding at higher platelet counts are disseminated
              intravascular coagulation with contributory clotting factor
              deficiencies, structural lesions with loss of vascular integrity,
              and refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Several large
              studies have documented the safety of lowering the prophylactic
              platelet transfusion trigger from the previously used 20 x
              10(3)/microL to 10 x 10(3)/microL. A few studies have even
              suggested that a 5 x 10(3)/microL trigger is acceptable. Based on
              these results, the next step of giving just therapeutic platelet
              transfusions is being evaluated. In a large retrospective study,
              the most significant predictor of bleeding was not the patient's
              platelet count but a history of bleeding in the prior 5 days.
              These data suggest that attention should be focused on providing
              aggressive platelet therapy for active bleeding rather than
              transfusing platelets prophylactically. Therapeutic platelet
              transfusions have been documented to control bleeding, and
              mortality rates are not increased when comparing patients
              receiving therapeutic to that seen in patients receiving
              prophylactic platelet transfusions.",

  abstract = "Background: It is unknown why only some thrombocytopenic patients
              bleed despite equally low platelet counts. Platelet function is
              likely to be of importance, but is difficult to access as results
              from existing platelet aggregation methods have major
              methodological limitations at low platelet count. Aims: The aim
              was to establish a method for measuring platelet aggregation of
              viable platelets in thrombocytopenic patients. Secondly, we
              investigated platelet function in thrombocytopenic patients with
              acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS). Methods:
              Washed platelets were split in two and differently labelled with
              fluorescent dye (Calcein AM and Calcein Violet) and added to
              AB-positive donor plasma in a 1.5 mL tube. Agonist was added
              (collagen-related peptide, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or
              thrombin-receptor activator peptide-6 (TRAP)), samples were
              shaken for 5 min and subsequently analyzed using flow cytometry.
              Double-colored events in stimulated samples were defined as
              platelet aggregates. Effect of addition of platelet inhibitors
              (abciximab, ticagrelor or vorapaxar) was determined. Using flow
              cytometry, platelet activation after addition of agonist to whole
              blood was evaluated by fl ow cytometry using antibodies to detect
              alpha-granule release (P-selectin(CD62p)), dense-granule release
              (CD63) and activated fibrinogen receptor (PAC1 binding),
              respectively. Surface receptor levels were quantified using
              antibodies against GPIIb/IIIa (CD41/CD61),
              GPIb(CD42b)/GPIX(CD42a)), and CD49b. Participants were $\geq$18
              years, healthy individuals or patients with AML or MDS.
              Participants who received platelet inhibitors within two weeks,
              platelet transfusions, or major surgery within one week were
              excluded. Informed consent was obtained. Comparisons were made
              with Wilcoxon ranksum test. Results: Presence of aggregates in
              unstimulated samples was low ($\leq$4\%). The intra-assay
              coefficient of variation was 1-3\%. Increasing inhibition of
              platelet aggregation at increasing dose of platelet inhibitors
              was observed. Enrolled were ten patients (n=8 AML/n=2 MDS) and
              nine healthy controls with platelet count ranging 6-47 x 109/L
              versus 145-337 x 109/L, respectively. The interindividual
              variation among healthy persons were low (Figure 1).
              Collagen-related peptide and TRAP-induced aggregation were lower
              for patients compared with controls, while no difference in
              ADP-induced aggregation was found. Three patients reported
              bleeding episodes within the past one month and comprised three
              out of four persons with platelet aggregation below 34\% for any
              agonist. No difference was observed in platelet count in patients
              with versus without bleeding episodes: 23 x109/L (12-24 x109/L)
              versus 25 x109/L (6-47 x109/L), p=0.51. Platelet activation was
              lower for patients versus controls for all agonists. There was a
              strong correlation between results from the platelet activation
              method and platelet aggregation method e.g. for PAC1-binding
              versus collagen- related peptide induced aggregation, r=0.96,
              p<0.001. No difference in expression of platelet surface receptor
              levels was found. Summary/Conclusions: Based on the presented
              method for testing platelet aggregation of viable cells, our
              study shows that low platelet aggregation by the method
              identifies thrombocytopenic patients with bleeding problems among
              AML/MDS patients with thrombocytopenia. This platelet aggregation
              method may be useful for providing indications for prophylactic
              platelet transfusions or for evaluating indication of platelet
              inhibitor therapy in thrombocytopenic individuals. Further, it
              may facilitate the important distinction between inherited
              thrombocytopenia from immune thrombocytopenia. (Figure

              determined and used as markers for the degree of DIC and for

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is an uncommon
              complication in patients with hematologic disorders although high
              fatality rates have been shown in these patients. At present, no
              epidemiological data regarding ICH in patients with hematologic
              disorders has been collected and/or reported in Thailand.
              OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the
              incidence of ICH in hospitalized patients with hematologic
              disorders and to identify predictive factors associated with ICH
              in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The medical records of
              all patients with hematologic disorders admitted to Siriraj
              Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) between January 2002 and September
              2011 were reviewed. Patients with ICH were identified and factors
              associated with ICH were investigated using a retrospective
              case-control design. RESULTS: Of 9,62 patients identified with
              hematologic disorders, ICH was diagnosed in 106 (1.1\%). The ICH
              rate was higher in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than in
              patients with other hematologic malignancies (4.29\% vs. 0.78\%;
              p<0. 001) and higher in aplastic anemia (AA) patients than in
              patients with other benign hematologic disorders (4.00\% vs.
              0.97\%; p<0.001). Cortical hemorrhage was the main presentation
              in all hematologic disorders, with a single lesion in the
              parietal area as the most common site. The overall mortality rate
              was 85\% with most patients succumbing within two days of onset.
              The independent predictors of ICH were hyperleukocytosis and a
              low platelet count in AML patients, and ecchymosis, upper
              gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and a low platelet count
              in AA patients. CONCLUSION: AML and AA patients had the highest
              risk of ICH compared with other hematologic disorders and several
              predictive factors for ICH were identified.",

              were admitted in the 285 departments of the university hospitals
              in Japan, in 1992. The incidence of DIC was high in acute
              promyelocytic leukemia, fulminant hepatitis, abruptio placentae,
              acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis. In cases of DIC,
              bleeding tendency due to consumption coagulopathy is most
              important, but organ dysfunction due to circulatory disturbances
              by development of multiple thrombi is also noteworthy. As a
              whole, DIC may be divided in two types. The first type is cases
              of DIC with severe bleeding symptoms. However, except cerebral
              hemorrhage, organ dysfunction is rare in these cases. These cases
              may be called as ``fibrinolysis-dominant DIC'', because
              hemostatic thrombi as well as thrombi which cause organ
              dysfunction by circulatory disturbances are rapidly removed by
              abnormally enhanced fibrinolysis. The second type involves cases
              of DIC with severe organ dysfunction. Bleeding symptoms in these
              cases are usually not severe. These cases may be called as
              ``coagulation-dominant DIC''. The most typical causative disease
              of the fibrinolysis-dominant DIC is acute promyelocytic leukemia.
              The most typical causative disease of the coagulation-dominant
              DIC is sepsis. The presence of causative disease of DIC,
              elevation of FDP, and depletion of platelet count are most
              important to diagnose DIC. In the treatment of DIC, removal of
              cause of DIC, administration of heparin to protect further
              development of multiple thrombi, and replacement of platelets in
              cases of acute leukemia are most important.",

              was referred to our service for further investigation. Patient
              was born at 35 weeks of gestation with intra-uterine growth
              restriction (birth weight 1440 grams). Post-natal history was
              significant for dysmorphic facies, global developmental delay,
              seizure disorder, chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count 70 -
              140 x 109/L) and subaortic stenosis. Bleeding diathesis workup
              including INR, aPTT, von Willebrand antigen, ristocetin co-factor
              and multimer analysis were normal. PFA-100 showed consistently
              prolonged closure times with Col/Epi and Col/ADP cartridges and
              platelet aggregation showed dis-aggregation with ADP, but normal
              ATP release. Peripheral blood karyotype showed 46, XY, r(21)
              (p11.2q22.3)[22]/45, XY, -21[8]. Fluorescent-in-situ
              hybridization (FISH) analysis for the RUNX1 locus showed 2 copies
              of RUNX1 in 116/200 (58\%) nuclei and one signal of RUNX1
              (consistent with loss of the ring chromosome 21) in 84/200 (42\%)
              nuclei analyzed. Transmission electron microscopy of patient
              platelets revealed frequent fused/large alpha granules, with
              approximately 20\% of the platelet population characterized as
              agranular or having few granules. PF4 in patient total platelet
              lysates was not significantly decreased as assessed by
              immunoblotting. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration
              of ultra-structural platelet abnormalities in a patient with
              RUNX1 haploinsufficiency. The molecular data from our patient
              helps elaborate the role of RUNX1 on both thrombocytopenia and
              platelet developmental abnormalities which also affect platelet
              function. Further use of electron microscopy in RUNX1
              haplodeficient cohort may help better understand and characterize
              this rare platelet disorder.",

              three groups according to the clinical stage of the disease.
              Thrombocytic adhesion, aggregation, activity of TF3 and TF4, of
              antithrombin III, FMDC level, FDP titre and fibrinolysis test
              were determined on the background of the screening coagulation
              tests. The studies were carried out before the treatment and were
              followed up after the therapeutic response or in the absence of
              improvement. Thirty per cent of the patients had manifestations
              of hemorrhagic diathesis, and 5 per cent - thromboembolism.
              Essential hemostatic deviations were found: progressive
              thrombocytopenia and thrombopathia and DIC syndrome that
              correlate with the stage of the disease, being most severe among
              the stage III patients. The patients that responded to the
              treatment had a great part of the hemostatic disorders corrected,
              and in case of no effect from the treatment - the deviations
              persisted, intensified and in 5 of the patients were responsible
              for the fatal end. The pathogenesis of the hemostatic deviations
              is complex and is associated with the characteristics of the
              basic disease and the concomitant complications.",
